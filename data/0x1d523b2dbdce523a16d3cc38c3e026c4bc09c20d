  "description": "Filip Hodas is a 28-year-old 3D artist based in Prague, Czech Republic. In 2015, Filip started a daily render project that lasted for almost 400 days and helped him gain initial traction online. Since then, he has grown to one of the most-followed 3D artists in the world, amassing almost 700k fans across his socials, which opened the door to collaborations with many international brands such as Adidas, Coca Cola, Samsung, or artists like Jean-Michel Jarre. Over the years, several of Filipâ€™s renderings went viral and made front pages of numerous sites and social networks from Bored Panda through Hypebeast to Reddit. He was also featured in many magazines and art books including Plastik Magazine, Esquire, El Mundo, Daily Mail or Dreamscapes by Gestalten. In his work, Filip balances on the edge between reality and fiction with elaborate, detailed renderings."
