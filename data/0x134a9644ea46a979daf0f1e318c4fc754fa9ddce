  "description": "A collection of 2000 generative animations, created by [Buff Monster](https://www.buffmonster.com/) and animated by [Jimmy in Motion](https://twitter.com/jimmy_in_motion).\n\nThe basis for this art collection is Buff Monster’s signature character called “Mister Melty”, presented here in mini form. Having used Mister Melty for over 10 years in murals, paintings, prints, and everything in between, this was a unique opportunity to explore the possibilities of generative artwork, looping animation, and the permanence that the blockchain offers. Jimmy in Motion tweaked and finessed all the various elements so that they move, drip and bounce in a perfectly smooth and joyful way. The end result is a collection of 2000 unique characters endlessly and optimistically walking into the future. \n\nMore information: [minimelties.com](https://www.minimelties.com/)."
