  "description": "Released on 28 June 2021, BullsOnTheBlock is a collection of 10K Bulls living on the Ethereum Blockchain as NFTs. View sister collections at:\r\n[BullsOnTheBlock Evo](https://opensea.io/collection/bullsontheblock-evo) | [BearsOnTheBlock](https://opensea.io/collection/bearsontheblock)\r\n\r\nOWNER COUNT: The owner count shown by OpenSea is misleading because of the fact that more than 1.9K people have evolved their Bull. By Evolving your bull, you will transfer your original bull to the vault and this vault is currently holding well over 6.3K original bulls. \r\nOwnership of either Bull NFT currently grants ownership of both Bull Collection NFTs.\r\nVisit www.bullsontheblock.com regularly for more details. Last Update: April 20, 2022"
