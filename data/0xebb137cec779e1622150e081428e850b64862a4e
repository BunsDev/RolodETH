  "description": "12775 of the bravest warriors in ChainFaces Arena met their demise while the arena was live in January of 2021. ChainFaces HD Undead allowed those who perished a chance to revive their fallen warrior for a small window of time. While their original CFA can never be brought back to life, this is an aesthetic reimagining of their once beloved heroes. \n\nAs with other ChainFaces collections, the art and metadata are both stored fully on chain.
