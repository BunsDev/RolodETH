  "description": "The tokens base metadata is stored directly in the contract with its field values generated on each tokenURI() contract call . It contains the name, image, animation_url. The name value is generated from the token_id. The image value has a base <svg> & the colors are generated onchain from the tokens seed. The animation colors and line heights are deterministically drawn in real time based on the tokens seed. The seed is a hash derived from keccak256(minter_address, token_id) which gives each piece its unique, one of a kind, look. The animation code is stored on IPFS and consumes the seed to drive the animation. The code for the animation generation is stored on IPFS with a LoFi beat to enhance the viewing experience. This project was created in 17 hours solely by Cr0wn_Gh0ul. It may also be used in the future to provide perks and rewards for subsequent projects."
