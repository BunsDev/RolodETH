  "description": "Welcome to The Seven Planets of Zero -- the new world of Greek mythology, interplanetary space politics, medieval kingdoms, and evil Titans.\n\nClaim your Character, build your army, strengthen your allies, and fight for survival in The Seven. Owning Characters in the storyline also means you inherit the ability to vote and collaborate on the story as well as receive royalties from Zero Gravity Labs revenue.\n\nBEGIN READING\nIt has been hundreds of thousands of years since The Void traveled back deep into the bowels of space and the Titans who used to inhabit The Seven have been gone for generations. In their place are people, humans, like you and me. Some of these humans still retain some residual magic from the sun Helios, and most are placed into positions of power once their magic is discovered. With shifting alliances and distrust, the leaders on these planets fight and war with each other as any society would when there is a desire for power."
