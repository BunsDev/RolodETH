They are all 100% unique and owned by you. \n\nAll holders have the right to reproduce and receive on going benefits, airdrops and are a special part of Remoâ€™s NFT eco system.\n\nAs of July 2020 this was the Genesis project by celebrated contemporary artist, Remo Camero.\nRobots created X Remo with additions X Disney animator Kiyoshi Kohatsu\n\nFor all my NFTS: https://linktr.ee/remocamero\n\nmain OS Account : https://opensea.io/accounts/REMOGRAPHY\n"
