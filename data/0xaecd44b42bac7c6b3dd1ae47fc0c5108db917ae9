  "description": "The Zombies have risen from their graves in the MetaVerse. They're angry for being disturbed by the last market crash.  A few famous, super rare and legendary Angry Zombies can be found all across the bunch! Each Angry Zombie grants access to exclusive perks such as a DAO community, as well as voting rights within the DAO and for its assets. You should be delightfully scared! ðŸ˜± MINTING IS LIVE on the website!"
