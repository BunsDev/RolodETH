  "description": "[MINT NOW](https://www.derpyape.io) | [DISCORD](https://www.discord.gg/derpyapes)\n\nA creative collection of 7777 apes, derping out on the Ethereum blockchain. Each Derpy Ape boasts a unique combination of hand-drawn traits, and grants access to a host of utilities. Our project was envision and built by NYC natives, and is ran by our community of dedicated holders. Holding a Derpy Ape gives you access to exclusive events, merch and contests, and places you into a one-of-a-kind community."
