  "description": "This is the OpenSea directory for Characters.\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/LootCharacters\r\nhttps://discord.gg/J56Z8Wr8\r\n\r\nCharacters are randomly generated and stored on chain. They were created as part of the Loot ecosystem. The goal with Characters is to expand the Loot ecosystem with additional possibilities and interactions.\r\n\r\nThe characters team, alongside other derivative projects are working on elements, games, integrations and engagement possibilities that will combine both Loot and Characters.\r\n\r\nImages and other functionalities are intentionally omitted for others to interpret.\r\n\r\nFeel free to use Characters in any way you want."
