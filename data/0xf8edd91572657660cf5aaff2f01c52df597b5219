  "description": "Not An Altcoin (NOTANAL)\n\nThis is NOT AN ALTCOIN, OK?\nIt's an nft project (not an altcoin). It just has no art, and no traits, and no rarity. And no roadmap. And no effort. Maybe generational welf. No guarantees.\n\nmint 0.01, total 1000 - use claim function from contract\ngas is super cheap cuz to mint there's literally nothing in the contract\n\nMint at ur own risk \nits not an altcoin btw\n"
