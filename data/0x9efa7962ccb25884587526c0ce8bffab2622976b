  "description": "More cute ERC721 foxes living on Ether chain! These amazingly cute foxes are offsprings of the origin Red fox! And they're cuter (also crazier) then their parents! Since no one can stand the cuteness of their parents. So there are 6 different species of their child (Yeah I know, pretty impressive right?). Fennec fox, Arctic fox, Bat-eared fox, Marble fox, Silver fox and Pale fox!\r\nThe adoption is taking place here : http://www.foxpunkjrs.com/"
