  "description": "Eternal Klay Pets is a limited collection of 10k NFTs thriving on the Ethereum network. These pets are insanely designed by Doug TenNapel, the creator of Earthworm Jim, The Neverhood and Nickelodeonâ€™s Catscratch. Join the Eternal Klay community on Discord. But here's the best news: every owner of an Eternal Klay Pets NFT owns the full licensing and ownership of their character. Doug TenNapel wants YOU to be responsible for the IP rights of your critter! Build a cast, make a show, comic, make merch, be the wizard!\r\n\r\nVisit http://eternalklaypets.io/ for more\r\n\r\nCoding by @Cloudcoastincr1 on twitter"
