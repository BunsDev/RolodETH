  "description": "In the distant future climate change has made Earth uninhabitable.\n\nIn desperation the remaining people on earth build a series of spaceships and try to depart the planet. Some fail at launch and go down in flames. Others warp to the past and engage with steampunk battleships, or warp to the future to face highly evolved deadly plants.\n\nResearch on the plants reveals a way forward: using the powerful psychedelic powers of plant extracts, the ships open neon hyperspace tunnels and travel to a distant earth future. Some land in the frozen north, some land in the tropical equator, and some land in the desert.\n\nSeeing the spiritual purity of the new settlers, angels arrive and raise the humans to a new level of psychic oneness."
