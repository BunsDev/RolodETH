  "description": "# Welcome to the Chris Vance Signature Skulls NFT Collection.  \nOnly 27 of these Signature (signed) Skull NFTs were hand-painted by Chris Vance - and minted through a NFT collaboration with [NiftyFusions](https://niftyfusions.com). After minting, all original artwork was destroyed.  These unique, rare NFT gallery collectibles will only live on as 4K NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nCollectors who own Chris Vance NFTs will be entitled to VIP access to future Collections, private access to VIP Vance Events at Art Shows across the country, and membership to the NiftyFusions Artist Collective. \n\n\nTo view additional collections, visit [Chris Vance on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/ChrisVanceArt).  \nTo learn more about Chris Vance, his Gallery works, or upcoming events, visit: [Chris Vance Art](https://chrisvanceart.com)"
