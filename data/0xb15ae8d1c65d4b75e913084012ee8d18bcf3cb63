  "description": "Gold has been the only universally acceptable means of payment throughout history. It's resistance to economic uncertainty has also been demonstrated over ages. Today, the limitation on the widespread use of gold in the modern era has been the issue of transportability and easy conversion to other currencies.  \r\n\r\nWith the “Return of the Gold Dinar” NFT collection by GCex, all that changes. \r\n\r\nThe Return of the Gold Dinar NFT collection is the world’s first halal NFT collection with both sentimental and intrinsic value. Each NFT is backed by a dedicated 4.25 grams gold coin in Gold Dinar Standard, with a unique serial number that dedicates the gold to the NFT owner. The physical gold is stored in a professional trustee’s vault and can be redeemed at anytime."
