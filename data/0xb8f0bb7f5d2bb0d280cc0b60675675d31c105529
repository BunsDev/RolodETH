Stake Tortoises to generate $EGG every day. But be careful! Goats are always trying to steal Tortoises and their precious [$EGG](https://etherscan.io/address/0x81d327cf395347dd6cc0c427bb9ea77ec120e304).\n\nEnchanted Game is a Risk2Earn game on the Ethereal Blockchain inspired by the Native Animals and Invasive Species that dwell on the Galapagos Archipelago. All metadata and images are generated and stored 100% on-chain. [No IPFS](https://etherscan.io/address/0x391f60b43619d39db931c645f863c12674a4da6e). NO API. Just the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n"
