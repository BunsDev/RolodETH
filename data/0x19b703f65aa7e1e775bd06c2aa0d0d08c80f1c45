  "description": "I'm Jonathan Mann, I've been writing and publishing a song a day on the internet every day or the last 4,700 days. I hold the Guinness Record for the longest continuous daily song publishingâ€”some people call me the Beeple of Music.\n\nBy sharing my daily stories with the world, I've gained a following of tens of thousands of fans and community members. Now, I'm giving it all back to the community: I'm turning all of my songs into NFTs that will provide royalties and governance of my entire catalog through SongADAO.\n\nBuy a song, join the DAO.\n\nhttps://songaday.world/songadao"
