  "description": "Gods Unchained is a free-to-play, turn-based competitive trading card game in which cards can be bought and sold on the OpenSea marketplace. Players use their collection to build decks of cards, and select a God to play with at the start of each match. The goal of the game is to reduce your opponent's life to zero. Each deck contains exactly 30 cards. On OpenSea, cards can be sold for a fixed price, auctioned, or sold in bundles."
