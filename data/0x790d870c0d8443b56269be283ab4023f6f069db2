  "description": "Introducing Skoolverse land!\n\nIf you have purchased a Scholarz from our collection here: https://opensea.io/collection/scholarz - now is the time to put them to work! How? By placing them in one of these lands. After a Scholarz stays at a land for a certain time, it gets activated. Activated land allows holders to take a bigger part in Scholarz ecosystem.\nFor more details, please read our medium post!"
