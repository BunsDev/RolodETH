Coming from The pencil of the Italian and danish yacht designer Marco Casali it is a mix of iconic futuristic style and performance shapes. “We choose the Vader for our first yacht NFT“ says Marco Casali “ because it’s the most advanced view on the future we ever developed. The 5 turbines pushing Vader up to 75knt are mixed with a green electric propulsion for slow emission free cruises.  \n\nThe influences of futuristic movies and metaverse landscapes are differently mixed on each unique Vader’s NFT including hidden codes and one easter egg” With more that 1300 cruising yachts done from Marco Casali Too-Design team  and several awards ,the design firm is now one of the most active and recognized in the world.\n"
