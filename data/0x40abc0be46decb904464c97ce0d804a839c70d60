  "description": "Fresh Fools is a 5757 NFT Collection, by a group of real life friends, who decided to work together to make the Fools a real thing.\nEach Fresh Fool will reside on the Ethereum blockchain as a unique NFT, made of a unique combination of hand-drawn traits that set them apart. Owning a Fresh Fool will not only make you more foolish, but will allow you to vote and participate on community-driven features, products and online events. This makes our roadmap cooperative and will allow Fool holders to help the founders decide on it, including how we spend our community wallet."
