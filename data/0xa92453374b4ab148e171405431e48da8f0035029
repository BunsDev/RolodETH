  "description": "Jon McNaughton is America’s foremost conservative artist. An outspoken critic of the left, McNaughton strives to paint images that express his ideas and beliefs. Hated and loved for his controversial work, viewers from around the globe write about the unique perspective of these paintings that seem to tap into the heart of American Patriotism.\n\n“The purpose of my painting is to communicate my ideas. American politics is filled with nuance and shades of grey, but I see the world through a prism of light and truth. My art reflects who I am and doesn’t use nuance or shades of grey to make my point. I want future generations to know exactly how I felt during this time in our country’s history.”\n\nThe McNifty NFTs are a new form of McNaughton painting. Every NFT is a one-of-a-kind interpretation created by McNaughton himself. Every trait hand painted by Jon McNaughton."
