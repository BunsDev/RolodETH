  "description": "Alien forces have invaded the previously peaceful planet of Cutelandia, home of the benevolent Bunny Buds. Forced to battle for their lives against robot hordes controlled by these invading marauders, as well as a zombie virus brought with them from the depths of interstellar space, these bunnies need all the help they can get to save their homeland.\n\nBunny Buds is a collection of 9,999 completely individual generative characters, approximately 75% good bunnies (Bunny Buds) and 25% bad bunnies, including the invading aliens, their Bunny Bot slaves and Zombunnies. Apart from the programmatic batch, there are 300 additional completely hand-drawn ultra-unique variants.\n\nFollow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bunnybudsnft) and join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/mNBzdEqYNa)."
