  "description": "Sno Demons are the companions to SuperYeti and are 3D randomized characters created through a standard ERC-721 contract and backed by IPFS storage on the Ethereum Blockchain. Sno Demons are smaller than the Yeti, but they are ferocious beasts that protect the yeti as the two have formed a symbiotic relationship. Each Sno Demon is unique and holds the key to future breeding in the Yetiverse"
