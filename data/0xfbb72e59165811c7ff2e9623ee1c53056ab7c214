  "description": "// 201 Originals - SOLD OUT! //\n\nWe're hard candy crypto art - Delicious and self aware.\n\nFun and unbothered until you threaten reproductive rights, then we're comin for you guns-a-blazin. With a portion of every sale going to fight for\nabortion access (100% for this genesis collection), you can sleep well knowing that every  Computer Cowgirl collectable is a satisfying way to say \"FUCK YOU.\"\n\nCollection by fashion photographer + collage motion artist Molly Dickson. All 201 Computer Cowgirls are collaged and animated by the artist (not programmatically generated).\n\n10 random cowgirls unlock exclusive art for the primary collector.\n\n100% of profits from our first collection fund abortion access in Texas through donations to the Fund Texas Choice organization."
