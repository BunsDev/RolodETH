  "description": "（Total 5,000）With the arrival of the dry season, the river also dried up a little bit to reveal the riverbed. Adam decided to take his group to migrate south, on the way Adam saw a herd of buffalo, the lions know that hunting buffalo is an incredibly dangerous thing, because the horns on the head of the buffalo is enough to kill an adult male lion, but because the food must do so, said dry Adam stared at a robust buffalo, only to see Adam light body leap down on the buffalo bite off the buffalo's throat, followed by a group of lionesses pounced on The buffalo was soon eaten up. After eating a good meal, the lions continued to travel. Soon they came to the south and drank the delicious sweet water again. The law of nature is ruthless, the strong eat the weak which is the natural order of things, only to become more powerful will not be eaten.\n"
