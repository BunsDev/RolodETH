  "description": "My work, whether photographic, conceptual or digital in origin, explores the intersection of architecture and the environment using a photographic bias. My series on Foundation // SCAR TISSUE // is an observation, through photography, on the effect of 'architecture' on the environment around us. The work aims to contrast the plethora of 'perfected' landscape images that we are saturated with and attempts to ask the question whether 'ugly' can look beautiful and have a deeper meaningful subtext."
