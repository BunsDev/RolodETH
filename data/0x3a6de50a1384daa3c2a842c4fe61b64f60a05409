  "description": "Mongo Mugs 2.5 exists as the culmination of process that happened owing to a sentence said to me by Jessica Yatrofsky while we were discussing the response by close friends to my first AI NFT project, Pepeverse.\n\nIn saying that senence, a massive thorn of despair was yanked from my heart so finally it completely stole my breath.\n\nI say that to say this: This art is for YOU. I love you, always.\n\nJessica Yatrofsky is my muse."
