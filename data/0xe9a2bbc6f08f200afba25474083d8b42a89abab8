Each of the 16200 NFTs consists of high-resolution, colorized imagery created from low-resolution, grey Mars photographs and represents a unique 2-by-2 degree surface area of the red planet. Each token comes with a unique set of traits describing natural features like craters, sc-ifi features like popular places from literature and over 60 more feature categories unique to the respective area. Owning a Mars NFT unlocks the ability to showcase objects on the open source Mars map app."
