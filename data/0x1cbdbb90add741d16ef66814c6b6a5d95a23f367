She mixes and matches multiple mediums to create nature-based, sometimes anatomical art that speaks for itself. Her work is sold internationally and her murals can be seen around the world. She has completed projects for such groups as The Ritz Carlton, The World Trade Center, Universal Music Group, Macy's, and The Superbowl and has been featured in The New York Times and Forbes."
