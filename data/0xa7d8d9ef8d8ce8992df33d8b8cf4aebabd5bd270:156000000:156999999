  "description": "How many moments make up a life? Some pass by without much thought while others last forever. They provoke emotions within us similar to frequencies on a wavelength. Moments is a journey into the simplicity yet profound complexity that a moment brings to our lives. Inspired by abstract expressionist oil paintings, each Moment is generated and cemented forever on the blockchain. These are the only moments we have. Never let them go."
