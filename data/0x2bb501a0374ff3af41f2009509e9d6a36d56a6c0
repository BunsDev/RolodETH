  "description": "LOGIK left St. Louis in pursuit of a dream. Arriving on the scene in Chicago as a fly on the wall, he navigated the underground art scene and rose within corporate America as an innovator. Now he is a cross-disciplinary alchemist minting gold connections among the next generation of visionaries.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nLOGIK becomes \"The Plug\" to holders of this NFT, which is programmed to provide increasing benefits (“juice”) the longer it is held. The juice level continuously increases every two months while it is held in your wallet. It will maintain a full charge forever once it reaches 100%. However, the juice level reverts to 1% when the NFT is sold if maximum juice has not been reached.\n\nwww.getjuice.today"
