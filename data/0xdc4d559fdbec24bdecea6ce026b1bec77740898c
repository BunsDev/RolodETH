  "description": "My Little Dark Age is a surreal series that explores the effects of death on life. I was faced with grief for the first time when my father passed away unexpectedly. In the aftermath, art became therapeutic in making sense of a new reality. Trauma can be a powerful creative force, and in grief, I created my most meaningful work. A thought-provoking, cathartic series on loss and feeling lost. Welcome to My Little Dark Age. "
