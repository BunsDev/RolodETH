  "description": "wΞlock is a Web3 smart lock system that enables authentication by NFTs, ENS, and other Smart Contracts. For example, you can easily create a place that only those with a particular NFT or ENS can enter.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENaHXQ6GqA\n\nAlthough wΞlock is still under development, we started an Early Access Program (EAP) so that you can try the preview version of wΞlock.\n\nPlease read carefully the [notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19qukuz8Ax95niKK1mdO9Z21TSiPgaiVHMoPoA1NHX6Q/edit#heading=h.17s0vaderbcc) and agree with them if you want to participate in the wΞlock EAP.\n\nFor more details, please see https://eap.w3lock.io/"
