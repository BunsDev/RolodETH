  "description": "Cyber CryptoSkulls are 5,000 collectible ERC-721 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) stored on Ethereum blockchain. It is the first [CryptoSkulls](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptoskulls) derivative project. \n\nThe initiative evokes the fantastic and unmistakable artistic DNA of the OG CryptoSkulls, and combines it with a cyberpunk aesthetic, incorporating new traits in line with it.  Dystopian times lie ahead, where bones and tech will come together to perpetuate the legacy of the Skullture.\n\nCreated by He-Maxi and launched on May 13th 2022.\n\nSOLD-OUT on August 7th 2022.\n\n\n\n"
