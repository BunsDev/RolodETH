  "description": "Attempts is the first lot from Ania Catherine and Dejha Ti’s Privacy Collection stemming from their Lumen Prize winning \"I'd rather be in a dark silence than.\" Each of the eleven unique works in the series is a choreographic attempt to establish online privacy (real or imagined). The body inhabits and hides inside a digital shell in the form of a translucent glass avatar, speaking to the pseudonymous nature of web3—pfps, usernames, wallet addresses—where one can ironically be known for being unknown. \n\nExploring the tension between privacy and transparency inherent to the blockchain, as well as the contradiction of self-expression and anonymity online, the work portrays an evolving attempt at alignment that is never achieved. The title of the series, Attempts, is rooted in the understanding that online privacy is nothing but a series of attempts. Each piece features an original score by Amon Tobin. \n\nMedium: Performance, 3D Avatar, Video, AI, Sound, Smart Contract/Key Pair, seedPoem "
