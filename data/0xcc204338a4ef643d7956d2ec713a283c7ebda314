  "description": "This collection is made up of images from the photography book The Endings.\n\nThe Endings is a collection of short stories told through still photography, each depicting the moments surrounding the end of a romantic relationship. The photos are not posed, they are acted. A cross between a fashion photograph and a film still. An actress was cast in each story for their ability to convey an intense moment in time and evoke a depth of emotion without the use of words.\n\nArt direction: Jessica Ennis"
