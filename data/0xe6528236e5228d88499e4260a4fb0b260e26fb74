  "description": "Ruggies is a Community that was built as a place where you can share and check in with what you're going through. With the Ruggies community we want to create with good vibes and a friendly atmosphere where people feel comfortable talking about what's on their mind.\n\nWe are a giveaway centered project with a healthy amount of ETH in our wallet to use to give back to the community in different ways. One way we give back is through our famous Rug Buyback program where we give you ETH for your rugged NFTs.\n\nCome join the Discord and say hello!"
