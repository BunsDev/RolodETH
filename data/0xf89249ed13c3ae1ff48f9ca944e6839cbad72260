  "description": "Kevin is a community owned virtual recording artist. His genesis NFTs are packed with utility, each holder becoming one of his music managers and getting voting rights in key career decisions. Holders will also be able to collect Kevin’s music NFT catalogue for free, starting with the original edition of Monkeys Spinning Monkeys, the most played piece of music in internet history. \n\nKevin’s Genesis NFTs were hand drawn by female artist Eli K Newman and include 450 traits. This is your chance to manage a future meta-star. Don’t let it slip."
