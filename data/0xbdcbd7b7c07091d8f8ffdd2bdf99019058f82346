  "description": "CryptoCities was developed in 2017 and launched officially in February 2018 as one of the first playable NFT's. It was recently upgraded to ERC-721 and a hard limit of 25,000 cities was introduced. Only one NFT can exist for any city in the real world - each carefully verified by it's co-ordinates and ranked by size (smaller towns and villages are currently included in this project too)."
