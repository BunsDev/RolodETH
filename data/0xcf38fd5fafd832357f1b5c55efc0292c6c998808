The evil Gargamel is guided by Dum Dum into the village of the elves, and the Smurfs are transported to New York's Central Park through the whirlpool of the blue moon to escape the Gargamel, where they have to rush to return to their mushroom village before the Gargamel and Azrael find them, and on the other hand, they only have three apples high to start their adventure in New York, the city of the Big Apple."
