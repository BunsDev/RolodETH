  "description": "Pixelglyphs are a set of 10,000 unique on-chain avatar NFTs created using a cellular automaton on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nInvaders! P2E game dropping soon! Learn more at https://www.invaders.wtf\n\nJoin us on Twitter and Discord for up to date information.\n\nPixelglyphs were created at random during the minting process. The cellular automaton algorithm ran on-chain, an NFT first. Pixel data and colors are stored on-chain. Your Pixelglyph can be re-created at any time using code.\n\nPixelglyph owners will be able to redeem a pxg.eth domain name. We have extended ENS names to create an NFT focused profile which utilizes ENS, but adds enhanced NFT functionality. Register at [pxg.wtf](https://pxg.wtf)\n\nPixelglyph holders can also redeem a small companion - a [Lil' Glyph](https://opensea.io/collection/lil-glyphs) - at [lg.pxg.wtf](https://lg.pxg.wtf) "
