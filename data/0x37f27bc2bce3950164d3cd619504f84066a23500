  "description": "Skull NFTs.\r\nMy name is Jason Sanders.  I go by DrainedEye online.  DrainedEye is an independently owned & operated artist gallery/brand.  My artwork is strongly fine art focused.  This Skull Collection is my first experience with Digital Art & NFT's.  I love the energy of the NFT Community & I want to thank you for spending time with my work.\r\n\r\nI know I'm not the first to explore this subject matter & I'm a big fan of those who've been focused on ðŸ’€ NFT's before I arrived here.  I want to personally thank Eddie Gangland for breaking ground & encouraging me and probably thousands of other artists to learn about the NFT space.\r\n\r\nI don't talk about it a lot, but I have a bone condition called Multiple Hereditary Exostoses.  This condition causes bone tumors to grow near your growth plates.  These large bone masses can be quite painful as they distort the muscles & tendons that have to work around them.  Due to this condition, Skulls have been an important part of my work for years."
