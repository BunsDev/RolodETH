  "description": "Skoltr, from old Norse. Word meaning: skull. The human skull contains eight (8) cranial bones and fourteen (14) facial skeleton bones. Skoltr is an art collection of 814 unique skull NFTs, individually created by the artist.\n\nSkoltr is built to spark social connections. The Skoltr tokens are built to provide long-term value to their owner. The project is built around a long-term approach of underpromising and overdelivering."
