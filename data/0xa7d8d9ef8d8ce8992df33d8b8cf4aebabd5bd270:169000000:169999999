  "description": "Primitive shapes generate complex and chaotic snapshots of a larger form, still images with a sense of rapid motion, going through repetitive sequencing of parametrized mathematical functions, rotations and placement of objects. Augmented Sequence is a project by Joonas Toivonen, building upon work on audiovisual installations and electronic music performances. The parameters for sequence attributes, shapes, lighting, materials and colors are driven by the hash of the minting transaction, producing unique and surprising results. \n"
