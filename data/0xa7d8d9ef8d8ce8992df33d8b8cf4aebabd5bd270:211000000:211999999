  "description": "A series of “freehand” mixed media drawings — made by an algorithm. In each drawing, three basic elements (horizontal lines, diagonal lines, and arcs) are extruded and rendered in three possible stroke types (pen, flat brush, and round brush). Simple variations produce a wide range of compositions — transforming the image from a flat graphic into a composition that evokes a series of spaces, a collection of objects, or anything in between."
