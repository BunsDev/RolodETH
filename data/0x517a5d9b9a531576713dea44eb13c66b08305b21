Each Skeletal Cat is unique and generated from over 180 possible traits, face, headwear, clothing, and more.All cats start off with 9 lives. Each rebirth brings them a little closer to death. Once a cat has gone through 8 of their lives, they are either granted entry into Paradise, or fall to The Abyss. The cats that bow down to none, who rebel against the norm, the outlaws, are cast down to The Abyss, reborn a Skeletal Cat."
