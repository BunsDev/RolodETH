  "description": "The Invisible Kids never felt seen in this world - ignored, forgotten, and disregarded. They've banded together for their one chance at showing the world who they are. Meet, and don't forget, the Invisible Kids.\n\nWe've built this community for anyone who has ever felt like an Invisible Kids. We're an all-inclusive community built on respect, kindness, and gratitude. The Invisible Kids have come together in the form of an NFT to have their voices heard and their faces seen. Help make an Invisible Kids dream come true!\n\nPlease practice our three core values (respect, kindness, and gratitude) every time you engage in our server. Every voice will be heard and no one will be left unseen.\n\nThe Invisible Kids Team thanks you and looks forward to meeting each and every one of you."
