  "description": "ESPADAS is a series of abstract paintings with the hyperreal atmosphere of digital media. Using familiar tools (MS Paint, Photoshop) with the intention of creating unexpected imagery, observations become distorted and reorganized to reflect new possibilities in digital image-making; investigating the intersection of these new “materials” on the artistic practice."
