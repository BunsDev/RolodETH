  "description": "A Golden Token | Reflections (GTRF) NFT provides you with a claim to mint a generative Reflections NFT art piece. You can only mint once and must be in-person (IRL) at Bright Moments Gallery in New York, NY during the November 18th, 2021 minting event.\n\nReflections is a Art Blocks Playground project by Jeff Davis that binds collectors to the generative work at the moment of its creation by revealing and minting the 100 pieces individually in-person (IRL) at Bright Moments.\n\nA GTRF NFT is not redeemable for an Reflections NFT after 11/18/2021.
