  "description": "-We are born from storms. We shine bright because we are rainbows-\n\nThis collection is a study of phalaenopsis orchids. It was born from a need to photograph blues and purples, but orchids come in so many colours, it quickly became a rainbow.\nEverything happens for a reason and this collection formed because I had something to say. I’m a chronic migraine sufferer. I live with pain and fatigue every day. I rarely leave the house and often spend my time in bed recovering, but that doesn’t stop me from dreaming for a brighter future and getting back up whenever I can. \nWe all have struggles but it’s how we react to them that matters. The biggest storms produce the most beautiful rainbows. \nWe are all rainbows, and we shine bright in all our colours.\n\nThis collection is minted with a Manifold (ERC-721) contract.\nThe minted collage will be gifted to one holder, chosen at random once each piece has been purchased."
