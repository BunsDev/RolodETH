  "description": "After the halving of 2024, \r\nthe Whales have taken control and reign in a dictatorship where blood flows, and \r\nwhere division is at its peak. In this chaotic world, humans and whales do not live \r\ntogether, they tear each other apart. \r\nThis Manga-NFT is innovative in its writing and in its constitution, where the project \r\nwants to be at the same time community thanks to its governance and general \r\npublic, with its will to aim a public beyond the crypto universe."
