  "description": "Links: https://linktr.ee/headless_chaos\n\nChaos is a headless band of 77 artists. \n\nThe Chaos Songs Collection is made up of 45 songs created by Chaos. Each song has been pressed into multiple NFTs - some more frequently repeated than others. The cover artwork is entirely unique to each NFT.\n\nChaos NFTs are minted by collecting and opening a [Chaos Pack](https://opensea.io/collection/chaos-packs).\n\nThe Official Chaos Site is [chaos.build](https://chaos.build).
