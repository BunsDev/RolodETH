  "description": "'hope to never forget volume two | lost in a daydream' is the continuation and final installment of this series. I spent so much of my childhood years daydreaming of being somewhere other than where I was. I would transport myself into motion pictures, wondering what it would be like to escape my small town that was falling by the wayside. as I've gotten older, my subconscious has lost saturation and vividity. this collection is a reclamation of the youthful vibrance of our daydreams. 30 1/1 Film Photos"
