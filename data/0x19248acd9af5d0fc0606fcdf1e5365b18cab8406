  "description": "Black Cat 3D is a re-creation based on Mimic Shhans. The inspiration came from a group of cat lovers who wanted to have their own black cat doll and bring black cats to life from Web3. MIMIC SHHANS is a public domain (CC0-licensed) NFT project that combines art with Shhan, a mimicking black cat who adores human culture."
