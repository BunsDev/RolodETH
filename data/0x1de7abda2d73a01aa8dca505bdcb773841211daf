  "description": "**OWNER COUNT and TRADED VOLUME:** The owner count and volume traded displayed on OpenSea is not entirely accurate. Majority of trading and utility staking happens on [Rollbot.com](https://rollbot.com). Total holder count is more than 4,000.\n\nA collection of 10,000 unique robots generated algorithmically using over 600 traits with proof of ownership on the Ethereum blockchain and a focus on utility. Inspired by Rollbit's first NFT project and other popular utility NFT projects, Sports Rollbots are based on the ERC-721 standard that underlies most digital collectible and utility projects.\n\nEach Rollbot is a sports-themed piece of digital art that doubles up as a personalised VIP membership for Rollbit's new sportsbook. Own a part of Rollbit's sportsbook and enjoy the perks!"
