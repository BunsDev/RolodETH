  "description": "\"Do you know what's better than a high-quality piece of art? A high-quality piece of art with a utility!â€œ\r\n\r\nWith this concept in mind, we went above and beyond to create an NFT collection that becomes a game-changer. The Last Raptor is a collection of 1923 generative Raptors with hundreds of hand-drawn pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal was to make each Raptor idiosyncratic to place a premium on quality above quantity. \r\nAs long as you hold at least one raptor in your wallet, you will be showered with benefits along the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n[TheLastRaptor](https://thelastraptor.com/)"
