  "description": "There are 8 species of ΞTHΞR FRΞAKΞRS, born in a special ERC721 [Ethereum contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3a275655586a049fe860be867d10cdae2ffc0f33). 🐙\r\n\r\nEvery FRΞAKΞR has a unique avatar depicting its abilities in the game. ❄\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery FRΞAKΞR has an innate value, depending on its fortune attribute and activity in the game. ☘️\r\n\r\nThe controller of a FRΞAKΞR is entitled to receive its share of total energy dissipation. 💰\r\n\r\n\r\nA FRΞAKΞR can capture other freakers. The likelihood of landing an attack depends on the relative agility. 🥷\r\n\r\nThe outcome of battle depends on the attacker’s total offensive power, and the defender’s total defensive power. ⚔️🛡\r\n\r\n\r\nBattling and moving freakers dissipates energy into the FRΞAKΞR energy pool. ⚡️\r\n\r\nThe stamina attribute determines how much energy a FRΞAKΞR disperses. 🌬\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn more at [https://ether.freakers.art](https://ether.freakers.art). 🦉"
