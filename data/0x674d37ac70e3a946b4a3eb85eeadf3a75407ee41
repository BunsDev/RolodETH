  "description": "A collection of 10,499 unique NFTs to help produce the movie based on The Infinite Machine, the best-selling book on the history of Ethereum by Camila Russo. 4,156 NFTs have been minted so far. The rest will be distributed in future sales in the coming weeks; dates TBA.\r\n\r\nThe collection is a collaborative effort by 36 emerging artists mainly from countries where decentralization has a major impact on lives and finances, including Cuba, Argentina, Venezuela, Kenya, Bolivia and Chile. 22.5% of sales go to the artists.\r\n\r\nEach artist created 10 versions of the Ethereum logo, plus 1 piece representing their vision of Ethereum values, and an original frame. Each of those artworks are then divided in 4 quadrants, to be programmatically combined with each other.\r\n\r\nAbout 30% of the collectionâ€™s NFTs will be randomly assigned with rewards: the option of appearing as an extra, visiting the movie shooting, an invitation to the premiere, being listed in the credits."
