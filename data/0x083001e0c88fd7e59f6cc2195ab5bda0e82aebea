  "description": "A series of 33 unique film photographs of Frank Ocean performing at XOYO, London on the 11th November 2011, released in sets of 11.\n\nThis was Ocean’s second ever live performance since the release of his critically acclaimed mixtape ‘nostalgia, ULTRA’. The show followed a cancelled New York live date and therefore his London show became his first European live performance ever.\n\nI attended the show as a 17-year-old student using a fake ID to gain entry. I spent £90 on my ticket which I bought on eBay after the original £15 tickets sold out in record time. I took a Kodak 35mm single-use film camera to mark the occasion. \n\nThese photographs express Ocean’s subdued artistry, musical flair, infectious personality, global talent, timid anxiety and everlasting history. \n\n- My Rugema on the 22nd August 2021"
