  "description": "Tom Yoo is a painter and sculptor who created both the first-ever sneaker NFT and the first-ever sneaker made from LEGO bricks. Yet he never imagined when he walked away from a career in investment banking/private equity that he'd become an artist. This is why Tom is always grateful to be able to combine his passions for art and sneakers into a career. He's also proud to represent as an Asian American/BIPOC artist and it's important to him to raise up the next generation of younger creatives who look like him. Tom's regularly featured by publications such as Hypebeast, Complex, Designboom, HighSnobiety, and more. "
