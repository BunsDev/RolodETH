  "description": "The Memes Collection is focused on the fight for the open metaverse (decentralization, community, self-sovereignty) and spreading this message to many people, many wallets.\r\n\r\nIt is a collection that is meant to be open and accessible. Edition sizes will generally be large and inexpensive, to spread the word and to avoid gas wars.\r\n\r\nWe will try to have a good time along the way, make some fun art, do great collabs and just generally have a good time.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit https://6529.io/collections/the-memes/",
