  "description": "The Blackout marks the first collection minted in the native token of Wasted World - $BLUB - and the third generation of characters in the Wasted Whales series.\n\nIn the darkest depths of the Opensea, the bottom feeders of Wasted World thrive on leftover $BLUB. Stake your blackout characters to yield $BLUB. Pair them with an afterparty or pregame character and earn higher yields.\n\nFind your tribe, build your squad, and flourish in everlasting $BLUB."
