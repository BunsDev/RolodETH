Each artwork is fully hand-drawn in Paris by Vinny, a french artist inspired by Picasso, Matisse and Basquiat.\n\nEach artwork is made up of different emotions spread over several parts of the body (head, neck, torso, etc.) which come together to form a unique personality. There are 11 evenly distributed with 5 positive (felicity, reverie, wisdom, love, joy), 1 neutral (surprise) and 5 negative (sadness, fear, anger, madness, anxiety)."
