  "description": "LITizens, you were invited to perform an Act of Kindness. You minted two Riders and were asked to gift one to a friend or family member who has no wallet or NFTs.\n\nFriends and family, you were gifted your first NFT by a gracious member of the LIT community and we welcome you to web3. We are at your service: https://discord.com/invite/D7GPVrmcq9.\n\nLet us consider what might be next for both givers and receivers of this Invitation to Kindness.\n\nThis is not for profit. This is for culture. Let's ride.\n\nArtwork by Rata"
