  "description": "This collection consists of 8,000 characters, each made up of over 220+ uniquely hand drawn layers on the Ethereum blockchain.  Brought to you by the creative mind of Sergio ‘Splurgeo’ Hernandez.  Sergio is an extremely talented tattoo and graffiti artist, as well as a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt! It was his vision to create a series of characters that would reflect the distinctive features of San Diego street culture, while also spreading Positive Vibes throughout the Web3 space and Metaverse.
