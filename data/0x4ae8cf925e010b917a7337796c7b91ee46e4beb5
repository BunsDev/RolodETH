  "description": "The Cassandra Complex is a series of artworks inspired by the Greek myth of Cassandra, who was given the gift of prophecy but also the curse to never be believed.\n\nThe series illustrates societyâ€™s fear of the future through humor, mischief, and slippery historical reference.\n\nWhile drawing a parallel between artists and oracles, both channeling visions of the future, the work suggests that everyone might be the oracle, the powerful and the by-stander.\n\nThe Cassandra Complex contains four signature VideoPaintings and a single edition VideoFeeling. Created in 2021 by Sarah Zucker ([@thesarahshow](http://www.twitter.com/thesarahshow)) on blank.art."
