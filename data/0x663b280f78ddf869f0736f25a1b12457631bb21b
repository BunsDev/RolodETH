  "description": "We all know what Chads are: manly men who take the bull by the horns, who eat red meat, smoke cigars, and don’t give a damn about hurting soy boy fee-fees. \nThe art of the Crypto Chads is done by world famous comic book artist, Mike S. Miller. Artist of the #1 digital \ncomic book worldwide for 5 years running, and #1 NY times best selling graphic novels: Injustice Gods Among Us, as well as \nNY Times best selling cover artist for Game of Thrones. In the NFT space, he’s been the artist on the Meta Bounty \nHunters, Funky Monkey Frat House, Pluto Alliance V1 & 2, and more upcoming.\nCrypto Chads work with a UK corporation that stakes into a multitude of launchpads, gaining a maximum number of IDO allocations that will airdrop free tokens into the wallets of those who hold Crypto Chad NFTs. Of course, there is no promise of monetary value, these are all simply speculative tokens air dropped for free. CHADS GET RADS!"
