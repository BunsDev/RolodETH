  "description": "YOU is a 8888 NFT project from the artist Peace, seeking to change the NFT norm, with an inclusive collection that anyone in the space can identify with.\n\n\n\"YOU\" will support and bring light to smaller artists in the NFT space, with a treasury that will be used to purchase 1/1 NFT art and raffle it off to holders. Every \"YOU\" piece will also act as a pass for all future art done by Peace. "
