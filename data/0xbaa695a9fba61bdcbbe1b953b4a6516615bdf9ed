  "description": "Ethereum Mining Commemorative Coin (2022) is an issuance of a virtual commemorative coin that memorialises the mining that contributed to the network between 2015 and 2022 – to be halted forever, after the Merge. A Ghibli-style short animation by animator Simon Mine introduces the coin as it floats across a desert landscape, recalling the initial branding of the Frontier release in 2015. Through a Homestead-like network, a miner bought off ebay is retired forever – and morphs into the commemorative coin. The reverse of the coin reveals an animated version of CNATCH & Hsiao-Wei Wang’s ‘Panda’ merge meme, compiling several key moments in Ethereum visuals. The soundtrack is from Amnesia Scanner’s Scammer project, a classic music NFT series launching open source royalty-free snippets on the Ethereum network in 2021. Everything, everywhere is always moving, forever – but history is not forgotten."
