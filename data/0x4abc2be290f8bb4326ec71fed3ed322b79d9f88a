  "description": "Since his genesis DRP in February, modern manga master Shintaro Kago has devoted himself to the development of his short film. \n\nABSTRACTION will be a completely uncensored release of Kago-san’s creativity, based loosely on universally recognised Bible stories.\n\nEVE OF REVOLUTION is the first behind-the-scenes release from the film’s production, with limited editions of characters and storyboards available from Kago’s creative process. Throughout the development of the anime, these episodic drops further permit collectors to participate in the act of creation and have individual input as bakers of the short."
