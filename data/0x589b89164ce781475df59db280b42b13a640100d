  "description": "IMPORTANT: Expand for full details of the collection.\n\nAtari 50th Anniversary Commemorative GFT Collection\nIn celebration of Atari’s 50th Anniversary, we joined forces to bring you a one-of-a-kind collection honoring the legendary gaming brand that started it all. \n\nNote: To redeem an Everyrealm x Atari Collective Pass, you MUST redeem 4 Non-Redeemed Atari GFTs. Redeemed GFTs will NOT be eligible towards redemption. To check, use the GFT Redemption Checker tool at https://atarigft.everyrealm.com/#check. Do NOT trust that the “Redeemed” Property on individual OpenSea GFT listings is accurate as the property may take a while to update on OpenSea after a GFT is redeemed. **Use the Checker tool instead.**\n\nFor every four non-redeemed GFTs you own, you may mint one Everyrealm x Atari Collective Pass for free (+ cost of gas)—gaining access to unique Everyrealm x Atari benefits!\n\nLearn more at https://atarigft.everyrealm.com/. Grab your GFT, meet us in the metaverse, and let the games begin. "
