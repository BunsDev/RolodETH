  "description": "MurAll is an on-chain digital collaborative mural/canvas/wall that anyone anywhere in the world can draw on, without restrictions on what you can draw. A neutral place that doesn’t filter, censor or stop any drawing. A place for true freedom of speech through art.\n\nThe only thing required to draw on MurAll is the PAINT token - a fixed supply ERC-20 token analogous with real life paint; you can't take paint off a wall and reuse it once it's on there, and similarly any PAINT used in drawing is burned as part of the transaction thus preventing it from being reused. When you draw, you also get a MURALL NFT of your contribution, a token containing your drawing, which you own and are free to do with as you please - hold, display, trade, collect, the choice is yours.\n\nThere is only enough supply of PAINT to allow MurAll to be drawn over in it's entirety a maximum of 21 thousand times, meaning MurAll has a finite lifespan; once PAINT runs out you won’t be able to draw on MurAll again."
