  "description": "The genesis collection “Muttniks” by Cosmic Paws celebrates the legacy and sacrifice of the first dogs to fly into space. Our bespoke platform allows collectors to interact directly with our random generator where they mint the Muttnik they love. The “Muttniks” rarities are solely determined by the collective minting choices made by the genesis token buyers–a fun feature of the Cosmic Paws minting process. Launched on July 22, 2021, the 70th Anniversary of the first flown canines in space (Dezik and Tsygan), Cosmic Paws began celebrating Earth's most famous Muttnik \"Laika\", who was the first living being to orbit the earth in a spacecraft. This collection commits the legacy of all Muttniks onto the blockchain."
