  "description": "BURNERÂ is a dynamic cryptoart series that changes every block in response to live Ethereum gas price data. A total of 256 interconnected artworks dependent on the state of the blockchain. As Ethereum network usage increases, due to price volatility, NFT sales or other factors, a more forceful artwork develops. \n\nGas price data is made from the competing desires, intentions and beliefs of millions of entities. Transactions on Ethereum create overwhelming amounts of information in block time, cyclically revealing unforeseen states. BURNER pictures this continuous decentralised process. The artwork is never finished, there's always a new variant."
