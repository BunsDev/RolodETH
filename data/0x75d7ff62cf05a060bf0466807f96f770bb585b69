  "description": "The SHADOWZ are the protectors of the SOUTHERN EMPIRE, the capital of the SHADOWZVERSE. Creative monks, warriors, mages and rogues that spend their days sharpening their skillz. But when they are transformed by the archvillain Retro into the 8Bit BITSHADOWZ, they must find their way out of his Arcade Labyrinth, a maze composed of the most difficult video game levels ever conceived!"
