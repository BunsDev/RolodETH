  "description": "A S2TM Space Pass secures your seat on a rocket ship with the S2TM Crew. Together, weâ€™ll embark on an intergalactic journey to save earth and its beautiful moon from being destroyed. Keep in mind that while Space Passes may look the same, they are not created equal. Some Space Passes have more utility as the story unfolds. There are only 5,000 S2TM Space Passes in existence. This is your access to an intergalactic journey of a lifetime. You in?"
