  "description": "The RIBONZ Trilogy is a three-part generative art series.\n\nPart 1, RIBONZ: Genesis, was inspired by physical phenomena and the true nature of reality. The energy ribbons radiate and compute the fundamental structures of time and space.\n\nPart 2, RIBONZ: Spacetime, explores how space and time themselves arise from the ribbons. https://opensea.io/collection/ribonzspacetime \n\nPart 3, RIBONZ: Infinity, examines what might happen when the ribbons travel beyond space as we know it. https://opensea.io/collection/ribonzinfinity\n\nLearn more on http://ribonz.art"
