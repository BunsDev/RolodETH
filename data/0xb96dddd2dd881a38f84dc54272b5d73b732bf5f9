  "description": "Daosaur Genesis collection dominates the NFT Space as the last surviving dinosaur. \n\nWe're apex predators, always ready to adapt, spotting trends right as they happen. \n\nWe hunt for Blue Chip projects and hold NFT raiding parties. We're decentralized reptiles, meaning we vote for change, investments, and raiding. As you trade and grow, so does the community. \n\nHolding a Daosaur NFT grants access to our ecosystem - Daosaur Tool, Alpha Group Discord, Marketplace, 3D Artwork and DAO.\n\nAre you ready for the hunt?"
