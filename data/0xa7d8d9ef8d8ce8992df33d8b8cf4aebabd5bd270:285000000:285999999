  "description": "Inspired by Max Tegmark's book Life 3.0, we envisioned what it is going to look like when a general AI starts a media company for the first time. An AI able to create and stream unique content to every human watching. \n\nSoon though, we realized that there was something else going on.\n\nAs the work progressed it became clear that Supermental is a way to question and express much of the friction that we see in NFTs and Web3. Especially around mental health.\n\nWhile we are firm believers in this new world we do have questions. And we do see red flags.\n\nWe often complain that some Web2 companies are causing depression and online addiction. And they are. But while the data and the assets might be free in Web3, are we better off when it comes to our mental health?\n\nIn the land of NFTs our online identity now consumes. Not only time, but money and assets. The mimetic status games are no longer confined to likes and followers. Now we deal in tangible value. This expansion of the mimetic scoreboard does not make it easier to live a balanced life. The benefit of being online has just increased dramatically for a lot of people. But it comes at a cost.\n\nHow do we ensure that we donâ€™t recreate our mistakes of the past? How do we make sure that online addiction does not become worse? How do we make sure that our mental health is not sacrificed once again.\n\nIf we really do own the platforms, the assets, and the memes, it should be in our best interest to create an online environment where proactive mental health is the default UX. \n\nWith Supermental we hope to draw attention to mental health issues in the Web3 and NFT space.\n\nSupermental is made by a duo. My partner wants to stay anon.\n\nTake care,\nJarl Rosenlykke\n\n---------\n\nControls\n\n- Click on the animation to change your mental state\n\n- Press space to pause and take a deep breath"
