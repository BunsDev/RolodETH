  "description": "ONE OF THE FIRST FINE ART COLLECTIBLES EVER SOLD DURING RARIBLE'S EARLY DAYS.  MAX OSIRIS AND MYSELF AT THE TIME WERE BATTLING THE SALES LEADERBOARDS AT THE TIME AND THIS MATERIAL WAS PART OF RARIBLE'S EARLY SALES GROWTH.  THIS SERIES IS A FUTURIST TAKE ON ORIGAMI AESTHETICS, USING PHOTO WARPING AND ABSTRACT LIFE FORMS AS SUBJECT.  ENJOY!\n \nロブネスの拡張ギャラリーには、写真の歪んだ抽象芸術が収められています。折り紙技法やデジタルファインアートの影響を受けています。"
