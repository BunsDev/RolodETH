  "description": "I love my fans, and I love Slipknot. I’ve been blessed to accomplish many things in my career, and this new way of thinking, creating, and connecting in Web3 will allow me to transfer my possessions to the hands of our community.\n \nI’ve strived to relinquish comfort for the sake of pushing boundaries, which is reflected in my life, my art, and in you - the culture we’ve created together. I do hope you can keep an open mind, and understand the deeper connection I have with this technology and the inspiration it’s provided for connecting my future with our past. Like the very nature of Slipknot, this is a leap of faith into a whole other world, and I will continue to learn, grow, and adapt in this world alongside you all each and every day."
