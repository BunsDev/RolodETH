  "description": "Carl is mounting an invasion of the town of Pixlton! He has brought along a bunch of cars for willing participants to use in the attack. Carl then modded the cars he sourced to get ready for the invasion. Little does he know that the town's infrastructure doesn't even allow for cars. Carl is a bit of a dim-witted chicken after all. Some cars are a bit more disheveled than others, but all of them are unique pixelated artworks in their own right."
