  "description": "Living Modules will be the first step to virtual real estate in the STARL Metaverse.  They represent your personal quarters where you can store your items, customize your interior and display your digital art and NFTs.\r\n\r\nThese limited edition NFTs act as key cards to access your room on each base in the metaverse and each one is originally designed by 3D artists.  Later Living Modules will not be limited edition one-off designs, and will have standard attributes and design to fit all travelers of the metaverse."
