  "description": "With the four Genesis NFTs as cornerstones, they built a vast and open marketplace. It would be a platform to celebrate culture, discover new art, transact in their currency OHM, and implement new ideas.\nAt Odyssey, we realized that there was a strong intersection between artistic innovation and community-building. The focal rule is respecting the vibe of the community first, and respecting the artist, like Dimitri Daniloff,  that resonates with that vibe. The core truth of our space is that no matter how fun things get, no matter how lucrative collecting becomes, the value comes from the community. We simply observe these pieces coming together, but the credit goes to the artists, curators, & collectors for generating this. Marketplaces should be the healthiest gathering points for those that generate value. We're excited to experiment with the next-gen platform design to that end."
