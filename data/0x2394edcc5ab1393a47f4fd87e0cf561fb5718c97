  "description": "MINTING LIVE at https://projectrxnegade.com\n\n\"The most fun and addictive minting experience.\" - Every RX Ape minter, 2022.\n\nThe first Project Rxnegade collection. 19,946 Ape NFTs generated randomly, on-demand, in real-time at the point of minting by Rxnegades members. Don't like your ape? Yeet it and get a new image, once per day, per token, until you are happy, then name it. You don't wait for the reveal, the reveal waits for you. \n\nEach RX Ape token is forever linked to the original Rxnegades member that minted it - using the new NFT Royalty Standard, the member that minted the RX Ape token receives royalties (0-10%) on all secondary sales (on marketplaces that support the standard)."
