  "description": "Aren't we tiny, alone on this little piece of rock floating in space, an insignificant atom in the great infinite soup of stars that is the universe?\r\nEarthâ€™s bravest pets left their humans in search of a new planet without those silly great apes. This is the beginning of a splendid epopee, between space exploration and existential questions."
