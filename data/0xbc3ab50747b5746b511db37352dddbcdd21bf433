  "description": "Pluralize means to make plural or express in the plural form. This series of photographs aims to pluralize the same idea or message with different genres of photography. Our goal is to showcase that the diversity of thought, process, and technique, can all come together to tell similar stories in their own unique way. We celebrate our diversity through unity of expression."
