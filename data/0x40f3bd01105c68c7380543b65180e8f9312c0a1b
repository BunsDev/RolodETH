  "description": "Commander Doug is a new kind of NFT collection that is a little xtra. Utility coded into the blockchain provides interactivity that allows holders to modify the rarity of the entire collection by combining NFTs. Combining two NFTs will burn them (removing them from your wallet and the collection) and mint a new and upgraded one for the holder. The Art changes in the sway that military ranks build upon lower ranks. All holders earn secondary market royalties at both an individual level and a community level according to a leaderboard of advancement. Visit [www.commanderdoug.io](https://www.commanderdoug.io) to explore your NFT earning potential."
