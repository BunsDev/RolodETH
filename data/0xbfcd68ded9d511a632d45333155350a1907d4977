  "description": "NessGraphics' Bored Ness Ape Club.\r\n\r\nAlthough Agent Ape #2306 may seem like he is the chimpion of the monkey business,you will come to the kongclusion that he is anything but. As he sits at his operations command center,he is solely responsible to remain bored,yet focused.\r\n\r\nThe mission,dubbed 'The Apes of Wrath' was green-lighted to ensure that the coordinated gorilla warfare against the primate change deniers is strategic and successful. As he quietly types away into the wee hours of the night,he keeps close watch on his community while making certain that not even one of his tribe is caught monkeying around or going bananas.\r\n\r\nExtra bananas for Danny_p3d for adding some shape to the ape."
