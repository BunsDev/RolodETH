They hunt for information and travel the numerous planets of this Reflective Universe. They create stories and go on incomprehensible journeys, overcoming many trials and hurdles. Their desire for knowledge of the universe is unlimited and unstoppable. They are just like us, but so much more. \n\nLearn more about the YOOMOOTA collection, our plans for the future, WAGMI Team Pass, and join the upcoming mint at yoomoota.io."
