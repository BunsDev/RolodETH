  "description": "Titled, \"Memories Of A Masterpiece,\" this collection of 999 artworks is inspired by the volition to capture, recreate, or relive a memory. Each piece leverages hand-cut paper, temporarily laid out and scanned. Leaning into the idea that moments are spontaneous and can never be replicated exactly, each artwork from this collection can only exist as a “memory” on the blockchain. The artwork traits pull from Amber’s lived experience as she created the pieces, furthering the notion that life itself is the masterpiece. "
