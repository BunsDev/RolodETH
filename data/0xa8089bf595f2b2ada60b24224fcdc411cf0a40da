Join our Discord for more information. \n\nFinally, a project created for the people by the people.  100% community driven and oriented. Royalty Black Card was founded on the idea of giving back to those in need. Our mission is to have a positive impact on the world by contributing to various charities (voted by our community) and aiding victims of rug pull scams using our dedicated relief fund, whilst rewarding our holders with the best-in-class utility for making the project a reality. We hold love and transparency as our highest values and aim to be recognized as the most generous project on the blockchain! We bring never before seen innovations to the NFT space by creating a unique one-of-a-kind membership and experience for our holders.
