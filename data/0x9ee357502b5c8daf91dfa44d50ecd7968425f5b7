  "description": "Everything is finite. Every organism, object, era, experience, or memory. It doesn't matter if it's a boring day or a world war conflict. Everything will eventually end. It may be terrifying, humbling, or both at the same time.\nI find it intriguing to put this concept of impermanence on a smart contract that is \"forever\". \n\nEverything is fundamentally binary, so I started with that. I transformed the idea into binary code and made artwork from it. Then I uploaded it to IPFS storage. An interesting thing is, that I didn't use it as an actual NFT. You can only see it in the form of an image link. The NFT that you see has a moving \"particle\" made from the original binary artwork. \n\nI wanted to showcase, that it doesn't matter how significant or insignificant something is. Big or small, nothing is permanent.  \n\nIf you are having a beautiful time, enjoy it, because it will end one day.\n\nIf you are going through a bad time, be strong, because it will end one day."
