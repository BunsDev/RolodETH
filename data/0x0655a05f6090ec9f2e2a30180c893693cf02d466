  "description": "Get your $CHIPs Staking is LIVE!!!\nhttp://www.royalflushapeclub.io/Staking\n\n\nThe Royal Flush Ape Club is a first-of-its-kind NFT collection of 8,888 ape themed playing cards living on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC721 tokens.\n\nWith a classic playing card value attached to each NFT, collecting a big hand means big staking rewards! Combine multiple cards to make your best hand: pairs, straights, full houses, or the ultra rare royal flush. Each will gain bonus staking and air drop rewards.\n\n8,888 will always be the maximum in the collection, but an additional 2,222 cards will be generated and will remain in the deck. Hodlers will have the ability to redraw a card from the deck using $CHIP tokens generated through staking, without increasing the max supply of cards.\n\nJoin our community on Discord today for a chance to join the VIP list and participate in community draws, games, and more!"
