These pandemic relief measures brought the public debt of the United States from 23.4 trillion U.S. dollars in February 2020 to around 27.9 trillion U.S. dollars in February 2021.\nNearly 1 out of 6 dollars in circulations was printed last year.\nSince 2000 the purchasing power of the USD lost 51,9%.\nGeorge Washington is screaming because fiat has no value anymore."
