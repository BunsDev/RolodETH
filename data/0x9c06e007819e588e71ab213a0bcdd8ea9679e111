  "description": "Back in the day when many NFT enthusiasts were not even born yet, Asia was producing the coolest tech and pop culture items with designs so iconic and significant that they are still in vogue 40 years later. The calm aesthetic of neon cities, anime, and lo-fi tunes is the safe haven on the internet that many of us turn to when we search for peace and balance. Our goal is to make people aware that now it is possible to own a piece of this aesthetic on the blockchain and bring the good old days to the Web 3.0. Our collection of retro-inspired NFTs will consist of 3 items starting with the watch- it is time travelling after all! For more info please visit https://etheretro.com/"
