  "description": "Aleatoric is an experiment in—and interrogation of—artistic intentionality, digital scarcity, and serendipity. As the artist, I have no direct control over the scarcity or abundance of the work, nor what it is titled, looks like, or sounds like.\n\nAleatoric is a conceptual hijink by one of the many matts (@1ofthemanymatts) and Evan Casey (@ev_ancasey)."
