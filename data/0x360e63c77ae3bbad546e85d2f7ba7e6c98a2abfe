  "description": "The Fae realm and web3 have something in common: in both, a name confers power. In the Fae, knowing someone's name - their True Name - confers power over them, much as knowing someone's private key does. The Equinox collection by ENS and Galaxis celebrates this connection, and the significance of names and identities in both worlds.\n\nThe Equinox collection consists of 12 unique NFTs issued monthly over a year, with the first to be released on the Spring Equinox. Each NFT celebrates a member of the Summer and Winter Fae courts, and anyone who can collect all 12 NFTs will have the unique opportunity to forge them into a single NFT representing both courts and the entire year.\n\nNFTs are raffled off each month to users who have contributed in some way to ENS and the ENS DAO, with criteria for each month's release determined by the DAO.\n"
