  "description": "The Mr. Everybody X Soda Factory collection is a 1052 piece generative art project made up of hand drawn backgrounds, girls, balloons and a variety of other traits. This is Mr. Everybody’s first NFT’s series and is also the first drop on The Soda Factory platform. \n\nDespite his now huge global following, celebrity clientele and worldwide solo exhibitions, Mr. Everybody’s street art roots can still be seen in his work today. His unique style offers up a clash of bleak imagery and playful vibrancy. This is evident in the balloon girl NFT series as Mr. Everybody stays true to his aesthetic throughout.\n\nThe Soda Factory is a platform helping traditional artists make the leap into the Blockchain/NFT space and Mr. Everybody is the perfect candidate for the platform’s first drop.\n\nFor more information on Mr. Everybody and The Soda Factory visit our website here https://www.sodafactory.io/"
