  "description": "**WE ARE FIFTY**\n\nWe are a close-knit team of 50 passionate NFT-artists born and raised in the metaverse. Though we each bring unique expertise to the team, all big design decisions are made collectively, to ensure we get it right first time.\n\nWe create generative art. Using the p5js framework you can directly mint our work to the Ethereum Blockchain. For every edition there will only be 999 pieces minted.\n\nEach edition will start from a different concept. So whilst the editions are created by the same 50 artists the style might be similar but the works from each edition will look different.\n\nMinting powered by [Sunflower](https://art.sunflower.industries/)"
