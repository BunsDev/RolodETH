  "description": "Far in the Open Sea lays Ape Island, notoriously known for its ape-ruled Kingdom. Despite a prestigious line of accomplishments and proprietary technology, the Ape Kingdom was never acknowledged by the outside world. Instead, it was made a mockery of and abandoned by the world around it. The Apes are now seeking revenge and aim to break free from the Open Sea."
