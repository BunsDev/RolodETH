  "description": "Spirit Orb Pets v0 is the pre-game collection of baby pets!  In preparation for the interactable v1 pets, these little guys act as early membership NFTs that will get a one time CARE token claim, will passively generate CARE tokens over time, item NFT airdrops, and a unique discord role!  Adopt one today!  Note that CARE tokens are exclusively meant for use in the Spirit Orb Pets blockchain-based pet-sim game and ecosystem and do not hold monetary value."
