  "description": "Borpacsso: https://opensea.io/collection/borpacasso\n\nSalvador Borpi https://opensea.io/collection/salvador-borpi\n\nA collection previously thought to be lost by the MOMB, given out exclusively to holders of Borpacasso- for free (just pay gas).\n\nMoMB blends popular internet culture with fine art precedents, subverting the art canon to develop an entirely new and widely recognizable NFT artform. Specifically, Borpaâ€™s abstractionist quality is married to integral 20th century modern art movements, beginning with cubism, heightening the authority of internet generated meme forms. MoMB presents the public with the unique opportunity to view, learn and interact with this emerging form."
