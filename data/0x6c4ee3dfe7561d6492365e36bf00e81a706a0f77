  "description": "Alotta Money is a French digital artist. He started his career as an illustrator then became one of the main actor of the Machinima scene with numerous international awards during 12years. He entered the Crypto art movement designing twitter headers artworks for many big influencers and projects and then jumped in the non fungible train, breaking sales records several times. His tokens take a defiant and anarchistic look at establishment from well-known masterpieces to fiat currency. Whether itâ€™s taped bananas or overzealous money printing, pretty much anything is fair game for this pioneer crypto art artist."
