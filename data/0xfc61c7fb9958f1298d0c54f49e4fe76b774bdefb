  "description": "DoodPunks is a 6666 uniquely generated derivative pixel art as a homage to the two best collections in the NFT space. We are promoting inclusivity and diversity in the Web3 space through our bright and jolly art. The characters traits are inspired by Doodles but in the iconic 24Ã—24 pixel format of Cryptopunks. After all, we are all jolly misfits in our own unique ways!\n\nWE ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH DOODLES OR CRYPTOPUNKS."
