  "description": "CryptoJunks.wtf are the *naughtiest* answer to the question: **“What do the bodies of the Punks look like?”** Launched in **April 2021**, each Junk is a unique 24x24 pixel masterpiece carefully crafted across 7 attributes and 6 rarities. You never know what kind of Junk you'll get. Pencil dicks, tentacles, strap ons, rockets, blue waffles, bearded clams, and ape vajayjays, plus hundreds more!\n\nLet’s be honest. We couldn't afford a Punk, so we made some Junk instead, and cranked it to 11. A labia of love by [ambition.wtf](http://ambition.wtf). \n\nNot affiliated with Larva Labs … obviously. "
