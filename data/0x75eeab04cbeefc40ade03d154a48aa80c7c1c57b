  "description": "So on 05/24/2021 I minted my first NFT ever.\nhttps://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:575784\n\nWhat drew me to the space was a certain level of freedom... this song HAS a video that no one has ever seen and can only be unlocked by my genesis. It was banned from being released by my label. Two reasons...\n\n1.I'm not in it (not famous enough to not be in my own video).\n\n2.It's focused on bullying (anti of course) and the images are VERY triggering. But I believed in it. I fought to release it and it was one of the FEW times I was out-voted. So it never came out.\n\nSince I left Baltimore in 2015 I thought it was all over for me and my music. My career was dead. Im fortunate.\nSo for my 1yr anniversary... I wanted to do something with the song because it was never formally released. And make it super cheap as just a huge THANK YOU to the people I've met along the way\n\nI never could have imagined any of this, or any of you... thank you for giving me my art back.\n\nKM"
