  "description": "Once upon a time, parrots and people lived in peace. But that all changed when the people started cutting down the rainforest. Only the parrots, who were able to fight, could stop the invaders. Over time, the people were defeated, but the desire to fight was still strong. To avoid another war, the parrotsâ€™ secret government decided to establish a tournament to let the bravest parrots fight and carve their names in the ages! And so the Parrots' Fight Club was born.
