  "description": "Stratosphere is the second volume to my genesis collection. A continuation of some of my favorite work to date. \n\nThe Stratosphere is the second layer of the atmosphere.  It contains the ozone layer, which absorbs the majority of the Sun's UV radiation. This is a vital function and life as we know it couldn't exist without it. I am forever grateful to be living on this planet during this time. It brings me great joy to be able to capture the beauty I get to experience and to share it with the world.  \n\nThis collection is also a metaphor for my journey as a photographer and artist. Just like a rocket leaving earth, my motivation and creativity are taking flight. The possibilities are endless, and this is just the beginning.  \n\nThis collection is 12 pieces \n\nAll Edition 1/1 \n\nAll images are captured by Vincent Schnabl, photographer based out of Revelstoke, British Columbia"
