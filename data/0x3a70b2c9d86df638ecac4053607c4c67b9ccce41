There are a total of 3,888 pixel tenjins with over 130 unique traits created by @timsonkk & CEO LABS. \n\nTenjins are one of the oldest god-like creatures in the world, who possess the ability to cross the border between real life and the metaverse. Being aware of the love and compassion lost in technological innovation, Tenjins set out to remind humans – never forget their forever companions.\n\nTenjin is also your key to access our future CEO LABS IP collaboration.
