In-game land is divided into plots based on the X,Y Project Coordinate Grid. Owners get exclusive rights to build on their plots and each plot is represented by an X,Y World NFT.\n\nX,Y World NFTs dynamically update based on what the linked land plot looks like in the X,Y World game. Buildings you create & changes you make in-game will show up on the corresponding NFT automatically. Customize your NFT!\n\nAssociate NFT Info:  \nX,Y World is an Associative NFT that automatically updates as you build on your land in-game.  \nAfter mint, your X,Y World is linked to your X,Y Coordinate. It goes wherever your Coordinate goes.  \nThis means X,Y World NFTs are transferrable, but only if you sell your linked X,Y Coordinate."
