  "description": "MetaWhips by WCC is a collection of 1,993 generative NFTs, signifying West Coast Customsâ€™ original year of incorporation and the beginning of a cultural phenomenon that lives on today.\n\nEach MetaWhip is generated using an extremely sophisticated computer algorithm that selects attributes from an inventory of thousands of individually hand-drawn 3D components, ensuring each one is an original work of art, with no two MetaWhips being the same."
