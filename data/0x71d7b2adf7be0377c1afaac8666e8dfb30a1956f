  "description": "Rotating nested squircles: a fully on-chain spin-off of \"Markov's Dream: Orb\" by Harm van den Dorpel, 2022. Colours, amount of rings, rotation speed and curvature are determined on mint. The animated vector graphics that compose this artwork are entirely generated by the Solidity code that the smart contract was programmed in. It does not rely on any web server or off-chain storage solution like IPFS, which means that this artwork is indestructible and will live on as long as the Ethereum blockchain exists."
