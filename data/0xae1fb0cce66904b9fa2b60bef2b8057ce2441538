  "description": "Welcome to REPLICATOR: the world's first self-replicating NFT\r\n\r\nOnly one Genesis REPLICATOR NFT will ever exist. Out of this Genesis REPLICATOR, up to 7 generations of unique NFT artworks will be produced. Each generation will advance the story of the artwork through time.\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\nEach REPLICATOR NFT can create a limited number of \"prints\" every 28 days, which are NFTâ€™s themselves. Each print will either be a next generation REPLICATOR NFT or a Jammed print NFT, based on contract probabilities. If a print is a Jam, it can be one of multiple variants, but can no longer create more NFT's. Any print created by a REPLICATOR goes to the owner of that REPLICATOR.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit maddogjones.com. The auction for the Genesis REPLICATOR NFT takes place between April 12-23, 2021 at Phillips auction house."
