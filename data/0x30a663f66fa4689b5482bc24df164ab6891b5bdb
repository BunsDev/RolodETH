  "description": "Zimmy Raiders are fantasy characters from distant lands. Each Zimmy holds a Creation Stone, and these stones give them access to unique powers and abilities. Much of the Zimmyverse is shrouded in mystery, but over time, it will unravel. The generative Zimmy Raider collection is here to allow a broader audience to enjoy the collectibles. Zimmy Raiders are generated using programming to ensure that no two are exactly alike. Think of Zimmy Raiders as vinyl toys or collectibles for your digital wallet."
