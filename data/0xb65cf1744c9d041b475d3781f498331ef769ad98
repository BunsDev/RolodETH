  "description": "Solon is a self-custodial wallet set to launch on Ethereum and layer 2 in Q4 2022. It is designed to reduce the financial barrier to entry and simplify the user experience. The protocol is fully decentralized and permissionless providing the highest level of security, trustlessness, and censorship resistance. Once deployed, the Solon protocol will function for the remainder of time dependent on the continual existence of the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\nEach Solon NFT has a \"Solon\" property, these tokens will be the governance / utility tokens of the Solon protocol. The Solon NFTs are also a pass to all in-person events, access to our private liquidity pool, membership for the Boule house in our metaverse space, and much more!\n\nThe Solon Protocol, the Solon Interface, the Solon Oracle, and Solon NFTs were developed by Solon Labs Corp.\n\nVisit our discord and website for more information."
