  "description": "SOLD OUT\nDear Dreamer 3 is the last installment of the Dear Dreamer series.  It is the smallest of the three collections, containing only 4 images to preserve the scarcity of my work. This entire series is my genesis in the NFT world and I have decided to only include my signature yellow dress images in this final collection.  The yellow dress is my pathway as an artist and NFT photographer.   \n\nThis collection of 4 images has been minted to the Ethereum Blockchain as ERC-721 Tokens using Manifold.xyz.\n\nThank you for viewing my heart & passion.\n\nSarah Lyndsay "
