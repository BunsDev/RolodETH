  "description": "There is a myth… 200 million years ago!\nThe air doesn't touch the soil, the rain doesn't feed the earth and the fire is everywhere, burning the last piece of life.\n\nPeople are dying…. Moms are giving the last piece of bread to their kids, while they pass away slowly.\nElders' hopes lay in rags!\n\nthere is no hope! and the only ones who caused this are the leaders of all the tribes in the world. they made it… for power and wealth.\n\nUntil one day, when a clan of Bear Spirits, once unjustly imprisoned in the depths of the earth, broke the walls under which they were kept and decided to take the fight with the world leaders! \n\nThey merged their spirits with all the elements of the planet, air, fire, earth and water!\nThey embarked on a journey of revenge!!"
