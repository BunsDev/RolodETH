  "description": "Launched in March 2018, Aether is the first metaverse build on NFT (ERC721). Visit our metaverse at **https://aethercity.org** and **https://discord.gg/aethercity**. A *building* is a top  level property in Aether that is occupied by a number of units.  A *unit* is the smallest form of property ownership in Aether. Our metaverse gives individuals control over a piece of the world where they are free to create unique experiences unlike anything in existence.\n\n\nOther Marketplaces:\n1. **[Aether Marketplace](https://docs.aethercity.org/marketplace)**\n2. **[Aether Wrapper](https://opensea.io/collection/aether-wrapped)**\n"
