  "description": "*“As we paint we move along step by step. \nWe realize that we are guided in our work by awareness of life.”* \n― Agnes Martin, 1979\n\nSteps is an invitation to slow down in order to explore a subtler dimension of reality, \nwhere two successive moments are never exactly the same,\nwhere we continually feel held and supported,\nand where each step, even if insignificant in appearance, can reveal unbounded peace.\n\n**Interaction**\nClick or Tap or Space key: Pause / Unpause animation\n\n**Prints**\nThe first 50 editions minted are eligible to receive one free signed 8.5\" x 11\" print (excluding shipping costs). All token holders will be able to purchase a signed print of the Steps mint they currently own.
