  "description": "Pigments is an exploration of colour and spatial distortion. Each instance is an abstract representation aimed at evoking a micro or macro-environment; from unknown substances, or oil in a canvas, to nebular formations. The pieces are animated, meant to be experienced live. The piece can run endlessly, with infinite output. To run it smoothly you need a capable GPU. If this proves to be too computationally intensive, or if you prefer a static view, feel free to press the spacebar."
