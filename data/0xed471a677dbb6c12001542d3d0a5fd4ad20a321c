  "description": "GitTrees planted in the ether. GitTrees are generated using a random seed in order to determine its growth and attributes. They will grow simultaneously every week, until reaching its maturity, where the GitTrees will stop growing. Once all GitTrees reach their maturity, their metadata will be stored in IPFS forever and the GitTree Generator will be released to the public to experiment with their own GitTree creations.\n\nWebsite: https://gittrees.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GitTrees\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/gUkB4QKJSv"
