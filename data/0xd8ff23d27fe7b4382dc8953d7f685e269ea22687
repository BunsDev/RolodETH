  "description": "ThankYouX is inspired by the pop tropes and bright colors of the NYC graffiti scene as well as tech innovation. He graduated from LA street stencils to paintings and sculpture exhibitions in London, LA, Miami, NYC and Hong Kong. Now using his street style in a more unique way, he has gained world wide attention for his geometric cube paintings and large scale abstract works. In 2020 he made the leap into the NFT space and now ThankYouX is bringing the physical and digital worlds together a unique collection of original paintings and NFTs. Welcome to CONVERGENCE."
