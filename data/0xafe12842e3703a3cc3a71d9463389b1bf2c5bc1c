  "description": "The year is 2022, and Bored Apes have taken over the metaverse. Everywhere you look, an ape with a lazy smile is staring directly at you. After awhile, the commoners got sick of the Apes and rose up. The leader of the revolution? The Miladys.\n\nBored Milady Maker is a collection of 6,911 generative pfpNFT's in a neochibi aesthetic inspired by street style tribes that infected the apes with Network Spirituality. \n"
