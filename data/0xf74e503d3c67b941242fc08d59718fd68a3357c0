  "description": "Baby Shark is the loveable earworm that took the world by storm since it first broke the internet with its ‘Baby Shark Dance’ video. With the most viewed video in the history of YouTube, Pinkfong’s Baby Shark is one of the most recognizable cultural icons to emerge from the internet and has garnered truly global status, reach and affinity.  \r\n\r\nWith more views in one video than humans in the entire world, Baby Shark generated unprecedented amounts of engagement on the internet, certifying RIAA Diamond (11x Platinum), and recording a 20-week streak on Billboard’s Hot 100.\r\n\r\nThe world of Baby Shark now enters the world of NFTs, introducing an exclusive opportunity for fans and collectors to own the first-ever official NFT pieces from the viral sensation and share in its journey."
