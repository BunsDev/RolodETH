  "description": "Goddess Energy\n#CARIBERSE Avatars \nArt by CHAMA CANDELA @uhcaribe\n\n\nYou know the “Hero’s journey”: hero goes on an adventure, is victorious in a decisive crisis, and then comes home changed or transformed… \n\n… well there’s also a “Heroine’s journey” and it’s basically the same except for this clear separation from what’s considered feminine in order to take action. After winning some battles, the need for inner balance becomes part of the transformation.\n\nPOWERFULMAMACITA shows Feminine Energy as wild, wise, creative, spontaneous, passionate, curious, diverse, fun, ever changing and evolving, emotional and sincere, nurturing and healing, intuitive and attractive, cyclic and intense. Helping heroes and heroines in there journey to self acceptance and inner balance.\n\nWhat is POWERFULMAMACITA?\nStrong Feminine Energy // Goddess Energy"
