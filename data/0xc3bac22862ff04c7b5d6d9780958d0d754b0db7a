  "description": "The Idea Becomes A Machine is a conceptual art project which explores art works as instructions using the medium of text prompt based AI image generation. The piece assembles a narrative from text prompts and generated images. The work references the wall drawings, structures and seminal essay “Paragraphs on Conceptual Art” by American conceptual artist Sol LeWitt and juxtaposes them with tropes from science fiction including autonomous robots and a super intelligent AI which sends information into the past from the deep future.\n"
