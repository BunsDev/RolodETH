  "description": "Trailblazing video artist and photographer William Wegman presents his inaugural NFTs, featuring his iconic Weimaraners. The six videos which make up the series Wait, Wait are available in editions of 3 and were exhibited at Frieze LA by Marc Selwyn Fine Art.\r\n\r\nWegman began working with his first dog in the 1970s, a Weimaraner he named Man Ray. Now, Wegman and his dogs are now making the jump into the web3 space. As Wegman videos often do, the works begin with something familiar: in this case, an onscreen loading graphic. In an era mediated both by screens and by the act of waiting—lockdowns, quarantining, waiting for vaccine appointments —these videos encompass something essential about the way we live now."
