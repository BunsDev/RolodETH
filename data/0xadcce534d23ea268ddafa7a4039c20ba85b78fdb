  "description": "Inspired by the myth of Prometheus, this series of artworks tells a story at once ancient and familiar.\r\n\r\nFire is the OG technology. Technology is so potent for humanity that it must be stolen from the gods. Through it, we can elevate ourselves beyond the bounds of our mortal flesh.\r\n\r\nIn this series, the artist illustrates this act of divine smuggling through humor, mischief, and slippery reference.\r\n\r\n**PROMETHEA** is a triptych of limited edition VideoPaintings and a single edition VideoFeeling by artist Sarah Zucker ([@thesarahshow](http://www.twitter.com/thesarahshow)). This collection, paired with an open edition title card, was originally released on NiftyGateway on January 19th, 2022."
