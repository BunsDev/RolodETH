  "description": "CharityPops leverage NFT technology to make donating to charity an act that helps both the donator and the charity. With most charities, you donate, and that’s it. With charity pops, you donate and receive an NFT that you hold forever— that entitles you to help decide which charities we donate to, and make a real difference.\n"
