  "description": "AltLayer OG Badges is a collection of 1000 NFTs with 600 of them minted so far. The first batch marks the launch of AltLayer. Out of these 400 NFTs, 300 of them were given to the OGs of the AltLayer community via a free mint event.\r\n\r\nAs the name “OG Badge” suggests, these NFTs have a symbolic value. These OG Badge NFT holders will play a crucial role in helping spread the word out about AltLayer and form the foundation of our future community."
