Each Legionnaire will be randomly crafted using a huge assortment of custom made 3D elements as well as customized backgrounds for each Legionnaire based on their Legion. Each Legionnaire will also be your ticket to the Satoshiverse and will be usable within the Satoshiverse play-to-earn game that is in development.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Satoshi’s Legions and the Satoshiverse please visit the links below.\r\n\r\nWebsite: https://www.satoshiverse.io/legions\r\n\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Satoshiverse_io\r\n\r\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/Satoshiverse"
