  "description": "The Genuine Human Art Contract Collection currently features A YEAR AT THE BEACH - a series of unique time-dependent animated cyberpunk pixel art pieces. The scene you see depends on when you view it. \n\nOn a summer day, a bright yellow lambo is parked up under the clear blue sky. On a winter night, a lone woman stands, wrapped up warm under the colourful stars. With eight different states, each animated pixel by pixel, A YEAR AT THE BEACH offers a new experience across the seasons. \n\nContract: Artist owned ERC721 \nHosting files: Arweave Blockchain \n\nWEBSITE: https://ayearatthebeach.art/\n"
