  "description": "Celebrating the wonders of the night sky.\n\nHow many times have you looked at the night sky and lost the sense of direction? Hidden in its darkness, aesthetic jewels wait to be discovered.\n\nThe telescope becomes a time machine. By looking through its mirrors and lenses, you can travel thousand, million, billion years into the past, to a time when stars and galaxies form and shine, overcoming entropy before eventually surrendering to it.\n\nThese marvels of beauty would never exist if any constant of nature would drift an unfathomably small fraction from its known value... Yet they are, in a dance of raging energy and delicate grace.\n\nJoin us for these short meditations of awe and wonder.\n\nWe will share the profit of the NFT sale with the community that provided the photos, astrobin.com.\nFor each sold item, 50% of the proceeds will go to the photographer, 10% to the website curators."
