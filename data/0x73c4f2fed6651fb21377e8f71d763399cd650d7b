  "description": "Eyes Yonder is a collection of generative art.\n\nThe collection is divided into 9 series, each advancing the artistic style of its predecessor. A common theme among all series is curves weaving through tightly packed simple shapes.\n\nA small number of special Eyes Yonder pieces were minted on Foundation and are visible on OpenSea through this collection.  The majority of the pieces were minted on OpenSea and are visible through (another)[https://opensea.io/collection/eyes-yonder] collection. "
