  "description": "The Prosocialites are a collection of 7,000 diverse characters which exist on the Ethereum blockchain as symbols for optimism. Theyâ€™re bold, independent voices, who know how vibrant our digital lives can become. You own the IP for your Prosocialite(s), which also serves as an entry point to the charitable web3 ecosystem that Etched began building in 2020 and the value, utility, and community access that comes with it."
