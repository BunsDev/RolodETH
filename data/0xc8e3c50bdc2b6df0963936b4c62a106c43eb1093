  "description": "We were blown away by the success of Bored Ape Yacht Club. As tech art fans, we wanted to see what would happen if we used these cool Apes to teach AI how to make art. The beautiful remakes of the famous Bored Ape Yacht Club were even better than we had expected.\n\nWe thought that everyone should see this, so we made a collection of 10,000 Apes that were made by AI. For us, this is the start of a big push in the NFT community to make generative AI art. NFT is the future of art, and tech is the future.\n\nIn addition, we will offer our AI system for everyone to use trough our website - BAIYC holders will get a 70% discount when using our service.\n\nThis is the first time something like this has been done, and we want you to be a part of it."
