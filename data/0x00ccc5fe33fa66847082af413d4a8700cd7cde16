  "description": "A Rug Just\r\nFor You\r\nThe Rug Pull Team has high expectations for this project after creating 6969 hand-painted rugs minted on the Ethereum blockchain for you to add to your collection.\r\n\r\nThe Rug Pull Team found one another through a journey of unfulfilled passions as every team member was shocked by the people within the NFT industry and communities. Now its our turn to deliver an experience you won’t ever forget.\r\n\r\nTo create that experience Rugs are packed to the brim with utility. This Rug is the one item you want to keep in your collection. There hasn’t been an NFT with such strong exclusivity appended since those beautiful spinning eggs. Are you going to be one of the many that look back and regret not getting your rug when you could?\r\n\r\nA total of 6969 (nice!) Rugs will be minted for .02 ETH each.\r\nAll minted rugs are rolled and hidden until 5 days after all rugs sell out.\r\nNo bonding curve... Because that would be a scam."
