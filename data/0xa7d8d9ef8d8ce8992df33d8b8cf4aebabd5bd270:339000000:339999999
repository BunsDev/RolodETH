  "description": "Ieva [iɛvʌ] is an algorithm that creates a shape in a specific sequence from a random point on the grid and smooths out its corners. Overlapping such shapes creates endless possibilities of combinations that will always remain balanced and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe title of this project is the name of the investigator who made a criminal case against me for making art. This name occupied a big part of my mind while working on this project. And I decided that it should be perpetuated in art.\n\nYou can do the \"investigation\" for Ieva (because she doesn't want to do it). To do so, you have to click on the art.\n\n**Controls:**\n\n- \"click\" = investigate\n- \"space\" = automatic investigation"
