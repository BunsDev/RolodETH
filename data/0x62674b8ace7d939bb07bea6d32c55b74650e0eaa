  "description": "EtherOrcs Allies is a collection of 12,000 100% on-chain warriors that aid Genesis Orcs in their conquest of Valkala. Four classes of Allies (Shamans, Tanks, Mages, and Rogues) each produce their own unique consumables as their entry point to the broader EtherOrcs game economy. \n\nEach Ally can participate in all aspects of gameplay within the ecosystem and will strengthen the Horde and solidify its place as champions in the on-chain metaverse.  \n\nEtherOrcs Genesis Collection: https://opensea.io/collection/ether-orcs"
