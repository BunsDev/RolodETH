  "description": "36 BLOCKS OF FUJI is a project with the aim of \"sharing a new Japanese culture of Reiwa to the world\" through the co-creation of a single NFT by 36 Japanese artists.\n\nThis project takes as its motif Katsushika Hokusai's famous work, Fugaku Sanju-Rokkei Kanagawa-oki Namiura (Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji), and divides it into 36 pieces (6x6), with 36 artists working on each part. In the end, the artists added their own unique expressions to make such a creative artwork."
