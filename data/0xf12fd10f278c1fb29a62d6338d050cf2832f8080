  "description": "Space Fight formed between 3 friends (2 Brits, 1 American) in a London pub over a pint. Shortly after, they appeared at the Camden Crawl Festival, toured the UK, were featured on BBC6 Music, and signed a record deal for their first LP --- In February 2022, they were about to sign a new deal for their second album. The label would take about 50% of everything, from Spotify, to NFTs, and anything in between. This time it didn't make much sense. They had been assembling a group of artists for a NFT version of the album - artists they had supported early in their web3 success stories who were now turning around to support Space Fight on their own journey.\n\n**This is what web3 was made for, to give the power back to the artists**\n\nDO YOU DREAM IN THE DAYLIGHT\n\nArt by Showdeer, Pop Wonder, OSF, tiffatronn, Ang Ramm, Dārta Katrīna, Perpetual Dream Maze, Louis Dazy, Jolene Casko, Etcha, Zach Winterton\n\nProduced by Space Fight\n\nMusic by Spen Miles/Tom Welch\n\nMixed by Andrew Maury and Tano Brock"
