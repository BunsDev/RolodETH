  "description": "Collectooors are the ones who successfully pushed through to the meta layer of \"collectorism\". The OGs who bought into blue chip NFTs before the hype. A collective of likeminded individuals who care about true innovation and the beauty of technological and artistic evolution through NFTs.\n\nThe collection is closely connected to $JPG, a blue chip NFT index that provides holders exposure to a diversified basket of top collections in a single, liquid ERC20 token. Holders will be given the opportunity to exercise voting power to influence future components of the index & direct yield & airdrops accrued by the index.  Art by cafpunk."
