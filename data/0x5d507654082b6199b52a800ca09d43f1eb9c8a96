  "description": "deckk* is the code foundation for whatever you want to build, create and imagine. \n\n52 cards - 26 red, 26 black - 4 suits ♦♥♣♠, 13 ranked cards in each suit and 2 Jokers🃏🃏. These are the building blocks for the 5-card tokens you can mint for free on https://deckk.io \n\nApart from 5 playing card references, each token contains the commanding card (identified with an asterisk *).\n\nThis is your code. This is your base to create whatever you wish: A game, a work of art, music... Anything is possible, and the options are endless.\n\nInstead of numbers, establish that they represent words, colours, shapes, instructions, names, body parts – whatever you desire. \nInstead of suits, establish that they represent a house, an address, a tribe, a location, or any other groupable characteristic you wish. \n\nInstead of red and black, establish that it represents day and night, high and low, or any other characteristic that suits you. \n\nThe true deckk* game only begins when all 8 888 pieces are minted.
