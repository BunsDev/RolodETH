  "description": "ALGER has addressed these technical obstacles by emulating and enhancing the ERC-4907 smart contract to strengthen the NFT market’s architecture. This facilitates the development of additional non-traditional financial derivatives. Our release of NFT, the realization of all the public’s imaginations, will enable the combination of NFT and the physical world to develop new applications"
