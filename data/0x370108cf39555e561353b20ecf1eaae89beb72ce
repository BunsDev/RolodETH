  "description": "Salvador Borpi https://opensea.io/collection/salvador-borpi\n\nAndy Borphol: https://opensea.io/collection/andy-borphol\n\nMoMB blends popular internet culture with fine art precedents, subverting the art canon to develop an entirely new and widely recognizable NFT artform. Specifically, Borpaâ€™s abstractionist quality is married to integral 20th century modern art movements, beginning with cubism, heightening the authority of internet generated meme forms. MoMB presents the public with the unique opportunity to view, learn and interact with this emerging form."
