  "description": "Animated art, generated entirely with p5.js code that is backed up and stored on chain.\n\nThe 2nd EVER user-created project on Sunflower Industries.\n\nAbstract, animated, generative art that meditates upon the cyclical nature of reality.\n\nFrom every breath we take to the spinning of the planets, the repetition of cycles binds time and the universe together.\n\nMirroring this, a loop of code creates these rotating pieces by printing circles in repeated, rotational symmetry."
