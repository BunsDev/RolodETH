  "description": "Meta-morphic is a generative art project that brings you on a journey through nature, art, and the creative world of Huang Yuxing.    \n\nMeta-morphic presents a narrative transcending the rules of nature and bringing us on a path of discovery, gaining and collecting treasures from the natural world.  \n\nHuang’s works have already passed the $8-million mark at auction, most recently via the sale of his epic riverscape Seven Treasure Pines (2016–19) which sold for HK$64.8 million ($8.3 million), more than 13 times its high estimate, a record sum for a Chinese artist born after 1970.    \n \nSee more information on:  \nWebsite: https://metamorphic.liveart.io/  \nMinting page: https://metamorphic.liveart.io/#/mint  \n"
