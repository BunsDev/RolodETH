  "description": "1,000 Pixelated Consoles, with 50 Genesis Consoles, that allow you to play the $Game. Use your X-Console to join us in  building the Decentralized Steam of P2E. \n\nUnder certain circumstances, your X-Console NFT may accumulate $Game when they are staked in a smart contract. $Game has no utility outside the scope of the X-Consoles ecosystem, and cannot be purchased from X-Console developers. \n\n*Unique ownership figures on OpenSea do not reflect actual unique ownership due to unique owners who have staked all their X-Consoles. These X-Consoles belong to a single staking wallet on OpenSea. There are currently over 500 unique owners for X-Consoles."
