  "description": "Michah Dowbak aka Mad Dog Jones is a multidisciplinary artist from Thunder Bay, Ontario. His works deftly interweave cyberpunk elements with the beauty and freedom of nature. As a lover of the wilderness, which was ever present where he grew up, he brings a fresh thematic to the metropolitan aesthetic, done up in citrus and neon tones of technology somehow rendered as a space naturally human. Over the last two years he has created artworks for Run The Jewels, Deadmau5, Jabbawockeez, Conor McGregor, Maroon 5 and Chromeo. His first and only IRL exhibit was AFTERL-IFE WORLD in Tokyo Sept-Nov 2019. His NG collection will be his first ever tokenized artworks!"
