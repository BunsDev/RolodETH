  "description": "To celebrate the WorldTourismDay, the illustrator @michtsai13 decided to choose ‘TRAVEL’ as the topic to become an NFT project.\nThat’s cus we both love to travel. Also, some people might miss the feeling of taking a trip as much as us since the pandemic began!\n\nWorld Tourism Day has been held on 27 September each year since 1980. The date marks the anniversary of the adoption of the Statutes of the Organization in 1970, paving the way for the establishment of UNWTO five years later."
