  "description": "We have recently changed to passive staking - so until all Bats are unstaked, holder count is incorrect.\n\n[Website](http://svs.gg) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/SVSNFT) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SVSNFT) | [IG](https://www.instagram.com/sneakyvampiresyndicate) | [Sneaky Vampire Syndicate](https://opensea.io/collection/sneaky-vampire-syndicate) | [Honoraries](https://opensea.io/collection/sneaky-vampire-syndicate-honoraries)\n\nThe Sneaky Bat Syndicate consists of 8,297 Bats – each owned by a Sneaky Vampire. The Bats are the Sneaky Vampires' official companions, claimed for only gas at a 1:1 holder rate to match their owner back in October 2021!\nWhile Vampires earn 3/$BLOOD/Day via staking, their Bat Companions earn 1/$BLOOD/Day – $BLOOD being at the centre of the SVS Ecosystem. The Bat Companions have a sneaky suspicion the Vampiresses are out for their $BLOOD… what could make them think that?!\n"
