  "description": "Hedgiez are beautiful, one-of-a-kind blockchain hedgehogs. Owning a Hedgiez gives you access to Quiller, the first of its kind matchmaking portal where you can swipe on other Hedgiez, swap spikey puns, unlock exclusive rewards, and even find love at first spike. With only 10,000 Hedgiez in circulation at Ξ0.06 each, there’s no better time to start living life on the hedge."
