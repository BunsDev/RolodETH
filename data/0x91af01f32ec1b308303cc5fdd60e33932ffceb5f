  "description": "Transformation is a significant theme in my life and my choice of creative expression. It keeps the fire burning, it seems.\nOftentimes, when change occurs, there is a transitional period during which boundaries are breached, fears surface frequently, and chaos reigns. For better or worse, outlets must make themselves readily available; this is where one comes in.\nThis is also related to a manifestation of beautiful chaos - something that does not conform to the natural order of things. \nThese are changes in oneself for the aim of transcendence, of new life emerging from what seemed to be endless chaos and the cooperation or eradication of the old order.\n\nThe great escape is the turning point.
