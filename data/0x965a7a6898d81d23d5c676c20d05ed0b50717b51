MetaSapiens were sent to earth as a gift to homo sapiens by MetaSupreme. Each action figure unlocks a hidden world known as the SupremeRealm which exists on earth but is not visible to the human eye. Using Augmented Reality cameras, mortals are able to interact with the SupremeRealm. Each MetaSapiens action figure is able to protect its human from the impending doom coming to earth.\n\n# The Artwork—\nA mix of art history, pop culture, and the history of humankind, each sculpture is a reflection of humanity. They are crafted from precious MetaStone™, an element invisible to the naked eye. In order to view MetaSapiens, humans must use an Augmented Reality assistance device known as “iPhone”.\n\n *` Requires iOS for best experience`*"
