  "description": "Literally Unwatchable is a conceptual photography series which creates stills from films that do not actually exist. Each piece takes many hours of effort and employs a different thematic style or medium. The idea being one which the photograph will look very familiar to many people even though no one has actually seen the film. \n\nThis collection is minted on its own 721 contract and first listed on LooksRare"
