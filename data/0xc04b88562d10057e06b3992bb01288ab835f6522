  "description": "A Golden Token | Incomplete Control (GTIC) NFT provides you with a claim to mint a generative Incomplete Control NFT art piece. You can only mint once and must be in-person (IRL) at Bright Moments Gallery in New York, NY during the December 9th - December 12th, 2021 minting event.\n\nIncomplete Control is a Art Blocks Playground project by Tyler Hobbs that binds collectors to the generative work at the moment of its creation by revealing and minting the 100 pieces individually in-person (IRL) at Bright Moments.\n\nA GTIC NFT is not redeemable for an Incomplete Control NFT after 12/12/2021.
