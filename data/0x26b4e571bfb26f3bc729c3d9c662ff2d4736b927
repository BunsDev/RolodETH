[Previous](https://opensea.io/collection/waltz-sunflower) â€” [Next](https://opensea.io/collection/pluma-si) | [View All](https://art.sunflower.industries/projects)**\n\nPerpetuation is a collection of deterministically generated abstract art. Each and every piece is randomly generated at the time of mint, varying individually in color schemes, motions, and sizes. It represents the abstract brought to life, perpetually stored on the blockchain, and perpetually in motion. \n\n**Press Space to pause, D to speed up, and A to slow down.**\n\nPerpetuation is the first community-voted curation project minted and deployed through [*Sunflower Industries*](https://art.sunflower.industries/)."
