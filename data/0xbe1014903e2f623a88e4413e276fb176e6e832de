  "description": "Tokenmon are a new species of NFTs born to evolve on the\nEthereum blockchain. Individual Tokenmon are generated\nprogrammatically from a random selection of hand drawn bases\nand attributes, each inspired by a nostalgia for all things\ncollectible, and a love of all things crypto. Though you\nwill only be able to mint level 1 Tokenmon, by collecting 3\nof the same base types you will be able to achieve evolution\nto higher levels through a burn and re-mint mechanism. There\nwill also be several mythically rare 1/1 Tokenmon, some in\nthe minter, and others which will need to be found in the\nmetaverse. As you build your desired collection, you can\ntrade your Tokenmon with other collectors using our swap\nfunction."
