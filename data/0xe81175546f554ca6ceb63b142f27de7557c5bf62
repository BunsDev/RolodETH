  "description": "[Lunar](https://lunartoken.co/) is a virtual moon real estate NFT that [launched](https://lunartoken.medium.com/start-your-moon-colony-today-1e43d2870686) on October 20, 2017. Only 400 sectors of the Moon exist and vary by size and location, making this collection extremely rare. Each plot includes a unique interactive 3D lunar map â€“ spin to see your plot!\n\nAll plots were originally claimed in late 2017 but remain available for trading. Due to the age of the project, Lunar plots from the official site must be wrapped first to make them compatible with OpenSea. Use the official [Lunar Wrapper](https://lunartoken.co/wrapper/index.html) to wrap or unwrap your plot.\n\nJoin the official [Lunar Discord](https://discord.gg/aqVPMmC3Ea), visit the [official site](http://lunartoken.co/), and follow on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/lunar_token)."
