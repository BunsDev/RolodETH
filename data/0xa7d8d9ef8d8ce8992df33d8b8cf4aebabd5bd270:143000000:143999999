  "description": "This project is a visual representation of realities that are out of phase. Interference patterns, colorful echoes, and emerging secrets are explored. Mathematical functions produce constant motion, but rarely, a peaceful scene resolves within the chaos. Click or press any key to pause. *Photosensitive seizure warning: These artworks contain flashing colors and moving patterns."
