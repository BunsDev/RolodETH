  "description": "Carousel Curated aims to become the worldâ€™s largest archive of found slide film. This ongoing catalog documents the pre-internet photographed human experience. Before the digital age, color positive slide film was used by professional and amateur photographers alike to display their work in slideshows. These images have been recovered through a global effort to archive photographs that would otherwise have been lost to dust and age in attics, antique shops, and flea markets."
