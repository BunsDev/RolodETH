  "description": "（Total 6,666）His flight speed is faster than a bullet, and his strength is greater than a locomotive. He can leap over tall buildings ...... In April 1938, in the inaugural issue of Action Comics, a hero wearing blue tights and a red cape was introduced. He had a shield-shaped S mark on his chest and held a car high above his head. This is Superman. He has an innate superpower and a strong sense of justice and compassion, every time in times of crisis, will be wearing blue tights, cloaked in red cape, disguised as Superman to do justice and save the world."
