  "description": "5000 Flippies have been immortalised on the Ethereum Blockchain. Chainflip Labs is bringing the world cross chain swapping, but we can’t do it alone. Instantly recognisable across the metaverse, Flippy is more than a JPEG. It’s a signal that yells - I stand with interoperability, I won’t rest until friction is abolished between chains, I am here to help the cause, I am Flippy."
