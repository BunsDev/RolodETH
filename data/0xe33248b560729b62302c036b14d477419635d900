  "description": "Roe Ethridge (American, b. 1969) takes equally from his work as a commercial photographer, and artist. Blurring the lines that separate the two, Ethridge creates images that are simultaneously generic and intimate, often treading between humor and cynicism. Functioning in tandem, these motivations coalesce into an ongoing investigation into the mechanics of photographs, and their ability to both retreat into the personal, and expand to relay collective experiences.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, Ethridge participated in New Visions, Henie Onstad Kunstsenter, Hovikodden, Norway. From 2016 to 2017, the Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati, hosted the first comprehensive survey of Ethridgeâ€™s work in the United States. Other solo exhibitions include: Shelter Island, FOAM, Amsterdam, 2016, Le Consortium, Dijon, France, 2012, traveled to Museum Leuven, Belgium, 2012. His work is held in the permanent collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art among many others."
