  "description": "These 4156 and ape-themed artworks were sold at the first-ever exhibition of the 4156 collection on 4/20/2021. They were displayed on the rooftop of 2 Deci Gateway in Cryptovoxels during the exhibition, and auctioned on OpenSea. Each participating artist received 90% of the proceeds from the sale of their work, with 10% going to the organizers of the exhibition. Special thank you to @metaverseDAO and @AccelerateArt, to @ClaireSilver12 and @benroy__ for hosting, to Gareth for building the exhibition space in Cryptovoxels, and to all the artists and collectors who participated."
