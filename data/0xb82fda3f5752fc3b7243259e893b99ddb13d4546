  "description": "**ATTENTION**\n\nThis collection is no ***longer valid***. Purchasing a mint pass will **NOT** result in giving you a Particlon avatar or give you access to metaverse events. This collection was a presale that entered owners into a raffle for a chance to win an NFT bundle, while also securing a free mint before WL and public mint windows. \n\nYou can find our Genesis collection here: https://opensea.io/collection/particlon-genesis \n\nIf you have any questions, please join our discord and ask team members here: https://discord.gg/particlon\n\n"
