  "description": "A generative art collection, by Y4000, of 1028 unique pieces offered as a gift to the community borne out of the ConstitutionDAO.  Inspired by the idea that people came together to \"own\" a copy of the Constitution â€” \"fractionally\" â€” (glossing over the technicals of DAOs and what was to be \"owned\"). This work plays off the delicate balance of order and disorder, more about the project can be found on [this write-up](https://mirror.xyz/y4000.eth/qdABP-a3NyeY-x_k7gtDN0TCeX8rVCO97XL7wmCU8N4)\n\nMint website: [https://constitution.y4000.xyz/](https://constitution.y4000.xyz/) â€” collectors can download a ðŸ–¨ printable resolution of their NFTs."
