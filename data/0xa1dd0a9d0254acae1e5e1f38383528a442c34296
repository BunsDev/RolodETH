  "description": "“If collectors want something intimate, really personal to the artist, there's the artist's own shit, that is really his.” — Piero Manzoni, 1961\n\nWhite Male Artist is widely respected as a pioneer in his field. His work has been exhibited all over the world, commanding many millions of dollars in sales. White Male Artist is presented by Phillips auction house, the renowned and prestigious auctioneers, whose sales date back centuries, and have included the estates of Napoleon Bonaparte and Queen Marie Antoinette. Let them eat cake.\n\nWhite Male Artist’s latest work, $HT Coin, is the first NFT of its kind, will be produced daily and each unique can will contain a nutritional label detailing what White Male Artist has consumed within a 24-hour cycle. $HT Coin cans will be the highest quality human shit on the market. White Male Artist hopes that you too will be inspired by your can, and that you too eat these famous artists’ meals, and make the same shit these white male artists make."
