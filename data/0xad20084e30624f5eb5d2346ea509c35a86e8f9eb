  "description": "STAKING & MARKETPLACE - https://www.y2123.io/ (No. of owners is not accurate due to NFTs being staked)\n\nSavannah Land NFTs: https://opensea.io/collection/savannah-land-y2123\n\nY2123 is an NFT-based blockchain game where you play as a citizen scientist racing against time to save Earth from climate change. \n\nInspired by Zoo Tycoon and Tamagotchi, you will have to restore your Land NFTs to good health by finding the right ecological balance of flora and fauna NFTs on it. There will be 4 habitats released in phases, consisting of Savannah, Marine, Rainforest and Urban. \n\nY2123 has sold out its genesis collection and is launching its land and 2nd generation NFTs in April 2022. Advised by a Pew Fellows marine biologist, we also have a philanthropic mission to aid the fight against climate change in real life. We are founded by 2 ex-Grabbers.\n\nWebsite: https://www.y2123.com/"
