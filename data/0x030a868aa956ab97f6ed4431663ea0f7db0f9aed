  "description": "3055, Derkein, A binary copy of an entire collection of 5000 Kongz, created by multiple radiation mutation crossed with X genes, was inserted inside Ethereum Blockchain. To solve the mystery behind the experiments, we created a community called Mutant Kongz Lab. A very smart and diverse group of people was trying to decipher the main code inside a private server, but accidentally mutate to Alpha when trying to solve the first problem. Meanwhile, the called, Beta mutants were screaming outside the Lab, trying to break in. This was the beginning of everything and could have the end already been defined. Mutant Kongz is a collection of 5000 generative arts with thousands of combinations."
