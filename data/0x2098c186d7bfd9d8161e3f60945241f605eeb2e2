  "description": "Each of these NFTs will be a unique witness to the B3AR MARKET of 2022. By minting one of these bears, you become the owner of a piece of history, for having been in the middle of the storm and not letting yourself be knocked down. You will have unlocked an accomplishment of your crypto life! This NFT is represented by an outrageous, mocking, arrogant bear, which feeds on our misfortune, and reminds us through its characteristics of the main events of this bear market (the fall of Luna, Celsius, Solend...). His banner makes it official that you are still here, and that you are one of the most resilient elements of the Cryptoworld."
