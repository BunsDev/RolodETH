  "description": "digital photography + digital image manipulation.\nstudio works, 2022.\n\nMy photography shows irreverence, lack of assumption of the rules, a vital need to do something else and question the established. This rebellious character itâ€™s my only path to freedom. Using my photography and my humor I get beautiful eye-catching results.\nIn this series of images I represent how I feel about social media consumerism, exaggerated dysmorphia and human self-domestication.\n\nonly a fool has no sense of humor~"
