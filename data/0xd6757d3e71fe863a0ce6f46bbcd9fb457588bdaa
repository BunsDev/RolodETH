  "description": "Broken Backgroundsâ„¢ is a generative art project by The Hundreds, inspired by a glitch in the initial reveal of select Adam Bomb Squad NFTs. The bug was re-framed as an added trait to the collectibles, supporting our thesis that our blemishes are what distinguish humans from technology. People, by nature, have the tendency to commit mistakes and fall short. Our lives are riddled with flaws and scarred by failures. The brokenness, however, is what makes us whole - and special. Each Broken Background NFT is a unique combination of background patterns, camouflages, and solid bases from the original Adam Bomb Squad NFT collection.\n"
