  "description": "777 Deadly Sins is a visualization of the sins in our world using a neural network that was trained to perceive the world in a way that mimics our human minds. This AI engine was fed genesis word(s) and a single ungodly image then run for 777 iterations at an average run time of 210 minutes per image in order to dream up a unique 1/1 art piece with that seed image. \n\n**777 Deadly Sins are stored on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-721 tokens. **\n\n**Mint at https://opensea.io/collection/mint-sins**"
