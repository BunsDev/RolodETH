  "description": "This is a collection of programmatically generated images. Our objective was to figure out how to properly architect NFT collections. The art wasn't our focus, so these are free to mint. We are plumbers, not painters. If you're an artist interested in collaborating on future projects, send us a note.\n\nAnti-style is here.\n\nhttps://substandard.wtf/\n"
