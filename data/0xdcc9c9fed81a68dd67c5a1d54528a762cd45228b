  "description": "Tired of always seeing the same stereotypical stories about Africa, I designed a new emoji every day of 2018 to celebrate our cultural diversity âœ¨\n\nThe project is now going web3 through a DAO dedicated to promoting African cultures and onboarding people from the continent to crypto.\n\nHalf of the sales will go to the DAO treasury."
