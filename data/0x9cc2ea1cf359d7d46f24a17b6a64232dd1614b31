  "description": "The NFS will be a legendary story about saving the cultural soul of our planet. For such an ambitious project, we’re bringing together cultural icons (stars) and integrating them with NFTs to tell the world’s first Non-fungible Story. \n\nThis will be a new democratic form of artistic expression, in which holders of NFTs will have the chance to influence the direction of the story and interact with the stars. The first collection, the first chapter, will feature Álvaro Morte, ‘the Professor’ from the hit series ‘Money Heist’."
