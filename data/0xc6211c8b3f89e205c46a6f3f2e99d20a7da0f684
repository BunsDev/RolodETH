  "description": "The rarest, historically significant 2017 NFT art collection on Ethereum by the artist Verdandi.\n\nVictoria Verdandi is the first female \"solo artist\" to have programmed and minted her own NFTs to the Ethereum blockchain in 2017.  The collection is now known as the \"Verdandi Artefacts\" and is the rarest NFT collection/project of 2017, with a mere 13 NFTs. \n\n**NOTE: These are the original 2017 NFTs wrapped in a new ERC721 contract by the artist herself.**"
