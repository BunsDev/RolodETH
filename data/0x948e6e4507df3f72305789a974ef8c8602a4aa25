  "description": "They once lived in a peaceful land with the wide renown name: Planet Jenkins!\n\nOh how the Wizards adored their planet!\n\nThey could freely cast spells, drink scromneesh and sing chants about the ancient wizards!\n\n\"La la la la bum bum da bum! The Elvin Melvin Skreldin Heldin!\" \n\nWhat amazing harmonies by the Jenkins. Applause Please!\n\nBut one day, the spells of the mages who oversaw the lands stopped working! \n\nHmmm.........What could it be...? \n\nWhat evil spirited darkness had flooded their world and powered them down? \n\nWell... Truth be told ...... The answer was in the manufacturing of Planet Jenkins.\n\nNo one knew they were shrinking as a planet.....\n\nFools... using their own Planet's core energy to power their spells...\n\nFrom then on, the Wizards set out to find a new planet.\n\nto colonize. To spread and preach the ways .\n\n...\n\nI wonder where the Money Bag Robs ended up. \n\nOh how they loved robin dodgin, samon, and jamon.\n\nThey could Rob all night long .. until they got their samon.
