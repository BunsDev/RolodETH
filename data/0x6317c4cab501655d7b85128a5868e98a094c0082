  "description": "The MonsterBuds Genesis Collection consists of 10,420 Generation 1 MonsterBuds and 865 Puff Puff Passes. \n\nGeneration 1 MonsterBuds are the center of the DankVerse and the key to earning in our P2E Smoke Session game. Generation 1 MonsterBuds will also generate $DANK, the utility token for the DankVerse. Each MonsterBud initially had two breed counts. When purchasing, make sure to verify each Bud's breed count using its token ID on [monsterbuds.io](https://monsterbuds.io). \n\nThe Puff Puff Pass is our utility pass for the DankVerse. Originally given to our early supporters for presale access, we've since utilized our Puff Puff Pass as a utility NFT, giving a number of premium benefits including NFT claims, software access, presale spots, and VIP access to exclusive events and giveaways. \n"
