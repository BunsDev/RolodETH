  "description": "Kong vs Kaiju is a fully on-chain NFT game involving a collection of 2499 Kongs and Kaijus, involving fun art, minting/staking mechanics and game theory. \nUsers are able to stake their Kaijus in the game to earn tokens that enable them to level up their NFTs, and more importantly mint additional Kaiju. 10% of all Kaiju minted are Kong NFTs, which have the ability to steal newly minted Kaijus and get paid tax when tokens are staked. \nOur utility token is used for all aspects of the game, as well as being used for voting.
