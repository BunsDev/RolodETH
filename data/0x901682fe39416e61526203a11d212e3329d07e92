  "description": "This work, a collaboration between Beeple and Locastro originally released in 2012, is a collectible video art NFT.\n\nChoose your favorite colorway and own a piece of contemporary art history.\n\nOne colorway is priced to be affordable for any collector, with 100 editions. The other 9 colorways are much more rare and exclusive with only 20 editions each, and get pricier the more they're purchased. \n\n"
