  "description": "A GAN, or a Generative Adversarial Network, is a type of machine learning framework that \"learns\" in an unsupervised manner.\nThis collection was created by training our GAN for over 300 hours based on 9940 HQ Original Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) images as well as our custom PKL file. \n\nThe PKL file is specially trained on psychedelic / abstract images. \nThe PKL file used to create this collection has been destroyed to ensure that the collection can never be restored and will remain unique forever. Everything is stored on IPFS - you own it forever. \n\nEXCLUSIVE CLAIM FOR BLOOT HOLDERS\n    "
