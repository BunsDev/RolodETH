Her personal work explores nostalgia & intimacy, focusing on the in-person energy that both binds and excites us in an increasingly digital world.\n\nHer debut NFT collection “Electric City” is influenced by NYC and combines abstract scenes with vibrant color to create mini dream worlds. Each piece is infused with the love, passion, and joy that Mason feels while creating.\n\nThis collection will feature 44 unique 1/1 hand-drawn pieces that highlight the individual electricity in each of us and the beauty that is found in building community. Each piece aims to bring positive energy and creative power to the collector - honoring the artist and storyteller inside us all.\n\n“These are pieces of my story - I hope they give you the courage to tell yours.” -Mason Eve"
