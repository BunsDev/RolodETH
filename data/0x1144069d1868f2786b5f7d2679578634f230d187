  "description": "ByeBanX (https://byebanx.art) is originally a collection of 100 genesis unique NFT art pieces that celebrate the crypto world & the evolution from cash & traditional banking to the world of cryptocurrency. As we say bye to many bank branches & see money flood into the digital crypto world what better way to show our acceptance than putting up our middle finger to the aging traditional systems of banks, cash & their centralized processes. The genesis set consists of the black & white versions of our art, & there are several upgraded variations which completes the NFT series, a set of 666 unique pieces. \n\nThe creative direction of this project is the brain child of a concoction of entrepreneurial prowess & pure artistic talent that has blossomed under partnership between our creative crypto heads & the marketing geniuses at FST, spearheaded with an individual proudly decorated with a first class honours in Illustration from the University of the Arts, London, Central Saint Martins."
