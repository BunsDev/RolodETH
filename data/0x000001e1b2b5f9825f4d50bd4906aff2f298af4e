  "description": "Imbued is a series of seven physical artworks by the artist Malin Bobeck Tadaa, made from optical fibre textiles connected to the Ethereum blockchain over Wi-Fi.  As you become the new owner of these NFT Weaves, you have the opportunity to imbue your NFT with your own interpretation of the artwork. These words are stored in the blockchain and will affect the expression of your NFT, as well as the visual appearance of the physical artwork, forever."
