  "description": "PunkBabies are the illegitimate offspring of Punks. Attributes were mixed, producing:\n•\t3840 human PunkBabies. \n•\t44 Zombie children\n•\t12 Ape infants\n•\t5 Alien offspring\n\nSome attributes have been manipulated for the PunkBabies, e.g. a thermometer replaces a cigarette and mustaches are milk instead of hair. There are also some new attributes since PunkBabies are no different to real babies – they poo, vomit and get snotty noses! Each PunkBaby also has a unique shirt color. The RGB color code of which is derived from it’s parents names.\n"
