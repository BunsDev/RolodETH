  "description": "The Archives is a curated selection of my lifes work minted on blockchain. After dropping out of college in 2017 I toured the world with my camera and my laptop. These photos are not only a testament to my journey and growth as an artist, but they also mark significant cultural events and figures that I was fortunate enough to document + be there to experience. Owning an Archives Image allows you to redeem for the physical print as well as Discord access/roles + more airdrops over time."
