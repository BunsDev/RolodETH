  "description": "BullsOnTheBlock Evolved on 15 Oct 2021. OG Bulls could be vaulted in order to Evolve the art of the Original Bull. View sister collections at:\n[BullsOnTheBlock](https://opensea.io/collection/bullsontheblock) | [BearsOnTheBlock](https://opensea.io/collection/bearsontheblock)\n\nOWNER COUNT: The owner count shown by OpenSea is misleading because of the fact that more than 1.9K people have evolved their Bull. By Evolving your bull, you will transfer your original bull to the vault and this vault is currently holding well over 6.3K original bulls. \nOwnership of either Bull NFT currently grants ownership of both Bull Collection NFTs.\nVisit www.bullsontheblock.com regularly for more details. Last Update: April 20, 2022"
