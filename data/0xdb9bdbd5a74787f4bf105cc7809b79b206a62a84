  "description": "The Cultiez collection is a unique generative art collection of 222 Cultiez minted on Ethereum. Each Culty is completely unique.. there are no two Cultiez that are the same. Owning a Culty means you are a rare member of the Cultiez community. That will give you early access to an upcoming social defi platform and is a key to the Cultiverse! Fun stuff is being planned for our community. Be on the lookout for the ultra-rare Cultiez prophets.. and the story begins....\n\nIn a fateful battle that violently shook our world, The Great Guardian was defeated by The Darkness and discarded by its foe, left to die a painful death - but the life of our planet has given him the strength to stand again. He lies in wait, in need of our help to rebuild its strength and stop The Darkness from coming to take over our land next. He will bring us salvation. Soon, he will return, and we will see the end of suffering. Or so we were told"
