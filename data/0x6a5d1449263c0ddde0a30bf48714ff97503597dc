  "description": "1,489 forgotten BLU3PRINTS were found, left behind by a distant civilization.\n\nA free drop from @abwagmi with a unique Sybil-resistant allowlist method.\n\nTraits generated on-chain, and BLU3PRINTS art is permanently mirrored in the contract.\n\nOwners can swap between portrait and landscape orientation at will. Each piece in the collection implicitly comes with both orientations."
