  "description": "Samuki was born on the planet of Meta and has always dreamed of traveling to distant worlds, winning battles and to be the greatest warriors in the world. When portals to other dimensions with hostile monsters began to appear in his home world, he was one of the first to defend his home planet. He decided to go on a raid alone to sweep the hostile territory. A familiar blacksmith forged him a special armor from the rarest materials and made him the sharpest sword that does not lose strength. Are you ready to go with Samuki to an unknown land and walk with him all the way to victory?"
