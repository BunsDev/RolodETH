  "description": "Most boosters are boosting Genesis Cool Monkes in the staking wallet, as such Opensea ownership numbers are not accurate, the total unique owner count will be tallied shortly!\n\nSupercharge your Cool Monke with 1 of 12 uniquely Cool Monke Boosters spread across 4 exciting rarity tiers! \n\nStake your Boosts and apply them to a Monke to increase the amount of $CMB your Genesis Cool Monke earns. Boosts will be updated with additional utility as the Monke World ecosystem expands.\n\nYour NFTs may accumulate a utility token (“$CMB”) when they are staked in the smart contract. $CMB has no other functionality other than within the Monke World Game ecosystem, and it cannot be purchased from The Cool Monke Developers. The Cool Monke Developers do not provide or intend to provide a secondary marketplace for $CMB."
