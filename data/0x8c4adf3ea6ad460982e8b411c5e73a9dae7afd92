  "description": "This is a very personal and lyrical collection of flowers that reminds me my childhood and the place where I grew up. No matter how far from home I am, there are always little things that remind me of my roots, and flowers are one of them. This collection is about the beauty that is born in the midst of the pain and that allows me to be myself. Coming home. Back to my old self, back to my roots.\n10 editions for each piece.\n0.1 ETH\nThank you."
