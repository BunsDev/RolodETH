  "description": "The FIRST ever NFT collection on Ethereum proof-of-stake üå±üå∏\n\nProof-on-chain ‚õì\nhttps://etherscan.io/block/15537394\n\nBLOOM is a Web3-native lifestyle brand.\n\nWe aim to bring the worlds of high fashion streetwear and NFTs together by exploring the concepts of Intellectual Property (IP) branding, the Zeitgeist, and the expression of Web3 culture in a contemporary way.\n\nRather than grafting web3 technology onto an existing brand as an afterthought, Bloom embraces the changing relationship between digital and physical goods with open arms.\n\nBLOOM is the flower of hope, a symbol of creativity, and the embodiment of freedom, love, and growth. As a community, we embrace self-love and care for sustainability in our creations.\n\nTogether with our communities, we will occupy the vast and constantly expanding universe. \n\nStarting with the \"Metaverse\". üåê\nhttps://bloom.xyz/"
