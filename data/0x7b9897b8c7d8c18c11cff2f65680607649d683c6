  "description": "\"PSXMA\" pronounced [soh-muh]\n\n\"Soma in ancient India, was an unidentified plant the juice of which was a fundamental offering of the Vedic sacrifices...After it was offered as a libation to the Gods, the remainder of the Soma was consumed by the priests and the sacrificer. It was highly valued for its exhilarating, probably hallucinogenic effect. The personified deity Soma was the 'Master of Plants,' the healer of disease, and the bestower of riches.\""
