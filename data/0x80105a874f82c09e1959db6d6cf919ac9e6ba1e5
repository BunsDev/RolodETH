  "description": "Cthulhu Armageddon 2022(CA22) is a community driven RPG (Role-Playing Game). You need at least one CA22 Character NFT to play the game.\n\nIn 2022, a year that is full of modernity and unknown, players, acting as students or teachers in Miskatonic University of this ever-cloudy Arkham, will get into this gripping and frightening story. \n\nCthulhu Armageddon 2022 lives on blockchain, which means that all characters and stories are NFTs, and collective decisions made by the community will eventually lead to the irreversible endgame.
