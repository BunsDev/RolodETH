  "description": "After their first collection [Smart Beast](https://opensea.io/collection/smartbeastcircle) sold out, a chemical accident occurred in one of the designers' labs while they were preparing a special asset to make the Smart Beast even more efficient. Unfortunately, countless Smart Beasts were infected and mutated into a new generation, more powerful and uncontrollable, with new utilities for their holders."
