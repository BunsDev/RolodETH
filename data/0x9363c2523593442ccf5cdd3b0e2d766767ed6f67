  "description": "The Roo Flex Genesis NFTs represent the shareholding NFT collection of the world's first charitable crypto crowdfunding ecosystem. By holding the Roo Flex NFTs, you are entitled to join the ROOs and participate in the DAO. DAO members are able to stake their Roo Flex NFTs and run examination or inspection on each charity proposal uploaded by NGOs by voting. Roo Flex NFTs holders are also entitled to 10% revenue share on every single fundraiser took place on the Roo Flex platform while having your Roo Flex NFTs staked.\n\nRoo Flex NFTs represent the mainstream “flexing cultural phenomenon” world we're living in. Roo Flex is also here to spread a message that we should always elevate our empathy for all the others instead of only valuing personal interest, enjoyment and wealth in order to help the world become a better place."
