  "description": "Sensors. Proof of photographic space. They exist as much for the viewer as for the tools used to make them. They emanate from the world, but tell nothing about it. They are drawings of the map in the machine. They have neither subject nor depth. They arenâ€™t meant to be read but seen up close. They show what the camera sensor sees, what is normally invisible. Digital noise. Salt.\n\nStarting from a base of 180 photographs, the NFTs in SALT will first display a different image and name in this set and cycle to the next on a daily basis. In sum, the underlying smart contract sets all 180 NFTs into an endless, asynchronous loop. No owner possesses a specific image, all are collectively shared.\n\nBy Figure31 and 0xmons in collaboration with JPG\n\n\"Mark Rothko Buddhist TV\" - Jerry Saltz, January 2022, Twitter."
