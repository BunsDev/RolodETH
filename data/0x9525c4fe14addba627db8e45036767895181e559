  "description": "'The year is 2051. OMEGA COVID has merged with ETH nodes across the globe, threatening the mechanized population of the once-human race. The W.H.D.O. (World Hard Drive Organization) has mandated that all Bots mask up to avoid spreading the disease through short-wave radio transmission. Hurry up and install an Antivirus!' This is an EXCLUSIVE, LIMITED EDITION collection from the creators of COVIDPunks, available only via airdrop to select users. COVIDBots cannot be minted by anyone. Not a Larva Labs Project."
