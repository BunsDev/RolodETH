  "description": "An exploration of your inner universe. Enter your forgotten feelings. This project explores the hidden part of mind, the subconscious. Through seven themes you visit different places in the subconscious mind. \n\nThe artwork comes in two versions. The screen artwork and a plotted version of it. You can switch to a preview of the plotted artwork as soon as the screen version is rendered by clicking on the image.\n\nA part of the release is to build a plotter that can plot huge artworks (100 x 100 cm as a first goal). For all mints purchased above 0.2 Eth a plot will be available to the collector for free. The size of the offered print corresponds to the price that the work was purchased during the Dutch Auction. You can see the offerings below:\n\n-purchased at 0.3 Eth, 30x30cm plotted on Axidraw plotter.\n-purchased at 0.5 Eth, 50x50cm plotted on custom made hang plotter.\n-purchased at 0.7 Eth, 70x70cm plotted on custom made hang plotter.\n-purchased at 1.0 Eth, 100x100cm plotted on custom made hang plotter.\n\nThe 30cm edition will be plotted and delivered first and the production will start immediately after the project is launched. Artworks will be plotted according to the mint order. \n\nThe larger editions will be produced as soon as the hang printer is finalized. The process will be shared on my website.
