  "description": "Slumdoge Billionaire NFTS have been algorithmically bred by AI rumoured to be stolen from one of Elon’s top engineers, or maybe it was Greg.\r\nStarting out with 19 base Doge breeds and over 200 unique traits there were over a billion possible combinations of traits but only 10,000 will ever make it to existence.\r\nEach Slumdoge Billionaire NFT is verifiably one-of-a-kind and the random nature of the trait assignment has led to a series of collectibles as unique and diverse as the Doge faithful themselves. From super rare traits to the most aesthetic woofer in town there’s a Slumdoge for every taste packed with pop culture references, influenced equally by movies, internet culture and streetwear and are 100% pandemic-chic."
