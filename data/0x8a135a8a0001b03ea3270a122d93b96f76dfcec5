  "description": "Zome.art presents 154ever, a collection of 30 images from Mariah Robertson. Using a large roll of photographic paper, and deploying a myriad of analogue techniques, Robertson created a single tapestry over the course of several days in the darkroom. She then photographed the tapestry, and divided it into 30 discrete images, now available as NFTs. Revealed as they are collected, the 30 images will also be stitched together in their original order, and displayed [here](https://art.zome.art/robertson/154ever). Once all 30 images are collected, the tapestry will be complete, and an NFT of the final piece will be airdropped to each primary collector. This is a unique opportunity to own both a part and a whole of a unique work by the artist, previously unavailable, and now archived on the blockchain. \n\nRobertson received her MFA from Yale University. She has exhibited widely at institutions such as MoMA PS1 and The ICP. Her work is in the collections of MoMA, the Whitney, and LACMA. "
