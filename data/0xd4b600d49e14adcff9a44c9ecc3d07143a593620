  "description": "The tensei turtle tribe is a collection of 333 genesis NFTs reincarnated on ETH ERC721. After being preyed upon by fierce dinosaurs on the mainland, the tensei turtle tribe fled to Ayssa Isle. One day a mysterious flask washed up on the beach, the contents of which seemed to evolve the tensei turtles to a more muscular, bigger species. Born were the meta turtles. Now It was time to return to the mainland and begin their destiny."
