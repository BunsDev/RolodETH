  "description": "Provably Rare Gem is a permissionless on-chain asset for hardcore collectors to mine and collect. Gems must be mined with off-chain Proof-of-Work. The higher the gem rarity, the more difficult it is to be found. Stats and other functionalities are intentionally omitted for others to interpret.
