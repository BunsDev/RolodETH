  "description": "The World of Freight is a collection of 10,000 unique Vehicle NFTs â€” tokenised digital collectables, generated from over 222 possible randomised traits, living on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-721 tokens and hosted on IPFS.\r\n\r\nYour Freight Vehicles double as your membership card, granting access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BOARDROOM, the collaborative space dedicated to building the Supplain protocol (https://supplain.io/).\r\n\r\nIn addition, your vehicles earn you daily WoF utility tokens, which can be used to upgrade your vehicles at the Garage, race them at the Racing Arena or burn them at the Junkyard in exchange for a new Vehicle or other rewards. The community can unlock future perks via active participation in regular events, social media engagement, and contributions to the Supplain protocol.\r\n\r\nVisit https://worldoffreight.xyz/ and follow @WorldOfFreight and @Supplain for more details."
