  "description": "One Alt Noun, every day, forever.\n\nAn **occüõ†Ô∏èexperiment **.\n\nThe first never-ending, completely on-chain art derivative of Nouns. Each Alt Noun is made from very the Noun it is based on. The Alt Nouns contract talks with the Nouns contract and generates an Alt Noun from this conversation. As long as there are Nouns, there will be Alt Nouns.\n\nNo ipfs/arweave, no rendering script. Just contracts talking to each other on the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\n[Alt Nouns](https://occ.xyz/altnouns) | [@onChainCo](https://twitter.com/onChainCo)"
