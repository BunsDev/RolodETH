  "description": "Long ago there was an explosion that caused an emergence in Fig deposits. Fig is the rare resource only found in the Land of the Unknown.\n\nFig began forming a consciousness of its own. It began expanding by forming sentient bodies, also known as figures, and with them, it formed the Figure Army.\n\nAnd now, 5555 Figures are emerging from the depths of the toy box."
