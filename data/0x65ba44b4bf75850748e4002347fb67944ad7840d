  "description": "Our visual system constructs structural patterns where none exist. Understanding this feature of our vision, regularities in periodic functions were exploited to embed structure on a piece of canvas using vector fields.\n\nVoid Attractors (VA) are a unique project inspired by Deafbeef and Art Blocks. VA combine the power of the Ethereum blockchain, generative algorithms, and game theory to shift how we think about on-chain art. \n\nVoid Attractors are (1/4) projects from the Unravelling set (https://unravelling.xyz/). Unravelling is aiming to reconceptualize decentralized on-chain generative art.\n\nThe second project in the series are Consensus Heartbeats (https://opensea.io/collection/consensus-heartbeats)."
