  "description": "The ICE WORLD is an exclusive collection of 2.765 soldiers NFTS. At the dawn of time, before the first man could call it home... Planet Earth was ruled by the Elements tribes. The rulers of all were the ICE MEN, the most advanced civilization to ever lay feet on the ground. These creatures shared the world with another race: TREE MEN. One came from the ice, the other from the ground laying under it but both shared a common goal: expanding their territories and taking over the entire planet. Which clan will you join?\n\nVisit www.iceworldnft.com to discover the multiple benefits & perks that come with being part of the community."
