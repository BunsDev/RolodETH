  "description": "Launched in September 2021, TIMEPieces is our brand's evolution into web3.\n\nLong Neckie Women of the Year is TIMEPieces’ first \"Artist-in-Residence\" Collection by 12-year-old phenom, Nyla Hayes. Long Neckie Women of the Year features 1,000 unique pieces in the style of Nyla’s Long Neckie Ladies and is based on [TIME’s Women of the Year franchise](https://time.com/100-women-of-the-year).\n\nTIME’s Women of the Year is the perfect franchise for Nyla’s work and her interest in representing a diverse set of women with long necks, mimicking her favorite dinosaur, the Brontosaurus. As Nyla translated each of the 100 women, she used the project as a history lesson, diving into the backgrounds of each woman through books and film.\n\nLearn more: [time.com/timepieces](time.com/timepieces)\n\nLicense Agreement: https://time.com/privacy/timepieces_license_agreement.html"
