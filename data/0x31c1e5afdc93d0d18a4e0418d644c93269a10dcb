  "description": "The collection was made keeping in xCollective's values and with the idea to spread positivity and joy but at the same time also be mindful of loss and hardships.The bright colors and face art are meant to highlight and celebrate accomplishments, even small ones. The backgrounds include symbols and nods to different aspects of life, some art subtle, and some require the viewers to dig deeper and search what that means to them. The traits are inclusive and diverse."
