  "description": "Each of the seven masks in NOTHING THE GOD OF BIOMECHANICS WOULDN’T LET YOU INTO HEAVEN FOR 1–7 is an NFT ed. 1/1. Beginning November 22, 2021, Dr. Woo will drop one mask a day for seven days, each for auctions lasting twenty-four hours. The bidding starts at 2 ETH for each token.\n\nWithin one year of the initial sale, the holder of the token can trade it in to Dr. Woo for a tattoo of the same image, up to 3 inches at its longest side. The token holder is responsible for booking the appointment with Dr. Woo’s Hideaway Suite, and must cover all travel and lodging expenses. Dr. Woo's Hideaway Suite is located in Hollywood, Los Angeles. If a token is redeemed for a tattoo, the image of the mask will be stripped from the token, but the token will remain tradable on the blockchain without the image of the mask. Each token in the series cannot be traded-in for a tattoo once the image is stripped."
