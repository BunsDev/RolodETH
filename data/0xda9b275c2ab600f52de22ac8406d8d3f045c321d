  "description": "The Way of Ging is simply a homage to the art of making beats. Something that is near and dear to my heart. I’ve had many musical explorations throughout my 20 year career. I’ve worked with the biggest and the best. In this moment I find myself back in a place that feels much like deja vu. The place where it all started for me. Creation for creations sake. Pure joy.\nAll art and music by Frank Dukes.\n\n\nPlease note After 11/26/21 this NFT will be the only remaining digital version of The Way of Ging. Soundcloud and any other links will be removed.\n\nThe winners of each auction will be given one vote to decide if The Way of Ging is made available to the world via streaming services. All votes must be registered via discord by Dec 3, 2021 6pm (PT) Happy bidding!"
