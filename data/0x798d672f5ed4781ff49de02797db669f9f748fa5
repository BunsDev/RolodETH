  "description": "\"Colours Of Space\" is the culmination of over 70 hours of gathered data that has been calibrated, stacked and processed over several months.  Lots of pre-planning, cold late nights capturing the night sky (and failed nights)and processing the data has been all worth it when I look back at this collection.\n\nAll these images are captured using my own telescope and dedicated astronomy camera from my back garden here in Scotland.  All the data has been carefully processed and curated by myself.\n\n*Collectors will gain early access to future collections and editions. \n\n*Collectors will have access to a high-res version of their NFT purchased. \n\n\n"
