  "description": "The ecosystem of Mythical Dreamland P2E game will be driven by the Mythical Creatures Genesis Collection and the Inhibitor. Alice token will help you navigate through Dreamland and build your collection of Mythical Friends.\n\nYou will need a minimum of 1-Genesis and 1-Inhibitor to participate in the P2E experience.\n\nEach Genesis PFP will grant you 1 NFT copy of each book in the series and will be a unique piece of art.\n\nGenesis NFTs will accumulate the Alice token when \"Phantom Staked\" (Developed by Tessera Labs, the holding company of Mythical Creatures). This method of staking allows your NFTs to remain in your wallet while being locked/staked. Alice has the only utility of being used within the Mythical Dreamland P2E game and cannot be purchased through any other means developed by Tessera Labs."
