  "description": "Billions of dollars are being stolen from artists in the film industry every year. For too long, Hollywood has been using inappropriate accounting practices to funnel money to the top. Our mission is to change that. Through web3, we ensure that artists are not only compensated for their work, but that fans can now have a piece of the pie.\n\nFounded by an Executive Producer (Daril Fannin) who has sold shows with Matt Damon and Jimmy Kimmel, and a 3x Tech Founder (Austin Worrell) whose last web3 startup reached over 500k holders and $500m market cap. Art by Emmy-nominated Art Director Kory Heinzen (Madagascar, Shrek, Megamind, and more)."
