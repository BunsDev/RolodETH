  "description": "Curious Cabins is a collection of isometric houses, hand drawn by Stefan Gro√üe Halbuer.\n\nFind the multi-edition NFTs of this collection here: https://opensea.io/collection/curious-cabins-multi\n\nThe Cabins artworks base on a fascination for whimsical architecture as well as isometric illustration. This interest originates in playing various strategic video games in the 90s and 2000s and today results in the creation of the Curious Cabins collection - Stefan's largest isometric art project so far.\n\nThe NFTs are minted on a custom Manifold smart contract. Maximum supply of Cabins will be 69, separated into different drops. Follow @grossehalbuer on Twitter for latest news and updates on the project!"
