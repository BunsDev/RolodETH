  "description": "The discovery of Shiny Objects from across the metaverse is what makes Web3 so exciting, and community makes it even better.\n\nFeathers are the first Shiny Object from the Shiny Object Social Club.\n\nOwning one gives you access to a lite version of Shiny DAO where you can collaborate with other members to discover, incubate and launch new ideas into the metaverse.\n\nThere will be 5000 Feathers in total released in waves of 1000. Each wave will be released according to consensus from other Feather holders.\n\nFunds will be deployed back into the Shiny Object Ecosystem to fund the creation of inspiring projects and initiatives."
