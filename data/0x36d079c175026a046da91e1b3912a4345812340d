  "description": "Kojo Marfo into the Metaverse. \nRather than producing artwork likenesses of real people, my art is focused on figures from my dreams and childhood memories so that I can create characters removed from reality. I work in this way, not only to pay respect to the visual memories of my childhood that were rooted in Akan cultural images, but also because I wanted the themes explored in the strangers to be more accessible to the viewer."
