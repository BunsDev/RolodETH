  "description": "Print Run is Aslan Ruby's edition collection, minted to our very own custom smart contract. All our editions will live here, and 1/1s will be on a separate contract/collection. Enjoy!\n\nAslan Ruby's work seeks to honour the every day person and highlight the poignant beauty in the small experiences we face daily. Aslan Ruby's pieces are often served with a fistful of colour and a sprinkle of humour that has human connection at its core. \n\nAll work is original work, imagined and drawn by Sarana Haeata/Aslan Ruby. All copyright remains with the author.\n"
