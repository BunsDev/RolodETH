  "description": "A genesis statement by process grey: 99 works released in 3 phases.\n\nIn the way that emotions stack in unpredictable ways, the medium of generative art yields a similar result as traits randomly stumble into one another. In this series the poetry of the metadata reveals as much as the image. \n\nThe fog in my life is depression- and that creates a haze through which I view all things.  Things remain blurry until suddenly in sharp focus, undeniable and abrupt- simply to fade back into the fog without warning.\n\nThis collection exists as one statement.  It was created as the conceptualization and companion for the work [here](https://collective.proof.xyz/grails-2/03), and likely others to follow."
