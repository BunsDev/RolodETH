  "description": "#\nEtherpoems are minted fully on-chain through a **\"collective deployed\"** smart contract.\n\nTraditionally, only a reference to a datastore (usually IPFS) lives on-chain, but with Etherpoems, the full poem is stored on-chain and guaranteed to last as long as the Ethereum blockchain does, regardless of what happens to IPFS or any other datastore!\n\nEtherpoems is also the first **“collective deployed“** contract. All proceeds from claiming Etherpoems and secondary sale royalties are split among all contributors trustlessly through blockchain technology."
