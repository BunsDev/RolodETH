  "description": "Early Majority is an outdoor community that makes gear for its members and empowers them to enjoy it. \n\nWe have an epic vision: to disrupt the environmentally toxic apparel industry by tapping into our global community of adventurers. We produce fewer, high-quality products uniquely for our members, and we grow by expanding supportive community rather than proliferating products.\n\nEvery Member Badge NFT grants the holder lifetime access to membership perks on the [Early Majority website](http://www.earlymajority.com), like exclusive and early access to new products, special member pricing, membersâ€™-only access to our online journal and more.  \n\nFollow [@earlymajority](https://www.twitter.com/earlymajority) or join the Discord to keep up-to-date on membership benefits and apparel claim details.\n\nSnapshot for tokens #1-150 was taken on September 22, 2022.  See [Mint Collection NFTs here](https://opensea.io/collection/early-majority-mint-collection).  Next Snapshot on November 1, 2022.\n"
