  "description": "Crypto Demonz Spawn1 is the flagship NFT collection and main staking rewards generator for https://LilithSwap.com ecosystem. Our unique NFT staking system uses the rarity of your NFT within it's collection to decide your staking rewards multiplier, meaning the more rare your NFT, the more passive rewards you earn! Our staking platform is designed to support pools for other NFT projects to allow liquidity and utility for new & upcoming NFT communities!\n\nSpawn1 Crypto Demonz are deflationary, they have 2 sacrifice periods to gain new, powerful NFTs called Spawn2 & 3. The Spawn2 sacrifice has already happened and only 7,000 of the original 10,000 Spawn1's are left in existence. After the Spawn3 sacrifice in 2022 - Q3, only 2,000 Spawn1's will remain, making them very scarce indeed.
