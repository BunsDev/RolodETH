  "description": "Welcome to the Crypto Afterlife\n\nThe Yokaimasks collection seeks to capture and celebrate the many faces of the elusive Yokai through artwork that expresses their features and forms. We are excited to bring to life this rich tradition of storytelling by merging our art with the digital asset ownership features of NFTs.\n\nThere will be only 3,000 masks total in the Yokaimasks collection. Each mask comes with an unique set of attributes that makes each one special. No two masks are alike. Viewers will be able to analyze these differences by using six key elements as their guide, allowing them to grade the relative rarity of each mask."
