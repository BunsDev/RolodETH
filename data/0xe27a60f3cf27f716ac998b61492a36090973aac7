  "description": "Fishermen and bears compete in the meta-prairies for the enticing prize of $TROUT. Play to earn game that provides utility to NFT holders through the Ethereum chain. 1 $TROUT = 1 $TROUT.  $TROUT has no other functionality other than within the TROUT Game ecosystem, and it cannot be purchased from The Bear Game Developers. The holder count on Opensea is not accurate as many NFTs are staked for gameplay."
