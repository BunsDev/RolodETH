  "description": "From renowned artist Miguel Paredes, Wheelies is the world's first NFT cartoon series - 30 years in the making! This 7,777 character collection represents the main characters appearing in the animated sitcom The Wheelies. Owners of the collection can enjoy an interactive experience with the cartoon unlike anything seen before with monthly drawings and sponsorships to get your Wheelie in the show itself. Over 30 years ago the Wheelies were originally developed as a comic strip appearing in New York Newspapers. The animated series is set in a fictional Orwellian world of Wheelieland, part of a complex microscopic universe within a paperclip found under the presidential desk in the Oval Office. The show bases much of its humor on parodying American pop culture, politics and the human condition.\n\nWebsite: https://thewheelies.io/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR2SjcqhS376Q1fA8wX-UNg\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Wheelies_NFT\n\n\n*Minting Live on https://thewheelies.governordao.org/"
