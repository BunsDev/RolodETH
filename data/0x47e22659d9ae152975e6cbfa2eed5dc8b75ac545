  "description": "Fortune drives the conversation about business. With a global perspective, the guiding wisdom of history, and an unflinching eye to the future, we report and reveal the stories that matter today—and that will matter even more tomorrow. \r\n\r\nFor its Aug./Sept. 2021 issue, themed “Crypto vs. Wall Street,” Fortune collaborated with pplpleasr, the artist who defined the aesthetic of the “decentralized finance” movement. Fortune is minting 256 editions of the animated cover art as NFTs—a number that nods to the 256-bit cryptographic keys at the heart of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether.\r\n\r\nFortune and pplpleasr also worked with Manifold on custom smart contracts for three special-edition NFTs. If one of a selection of crypto influencer wallets places a top bid, the graphics will change to feature their avatar or logo.\r\n\r\npplpleasr says her artwork represents the personality and potential of DeFi: “It’s a whole colorful, vibrant ecosystem and community, not just an investment platform\""
