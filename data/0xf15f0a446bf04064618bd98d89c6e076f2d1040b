  "description": "Zombie Apes Club is an indigenous tribe of humans who were discovered living on a desolate island where they were captured and experimented on causing them to mutate and devolve back to ape form.\n\nThey were left to roam freely on the island where they had to fend for themselves, this turned them into the creatures you see today."
