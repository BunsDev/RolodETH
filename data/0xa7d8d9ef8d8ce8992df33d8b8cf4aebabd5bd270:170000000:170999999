  "description": "Chroma Theory is the infinite animation filled with color, where you can experience slight movement, irregular pulse, and tonal diffusion. It's the abstract study of color coexistence and mutual interference, from pastel hues to vivid compositions. A minimalistic variation on visual media art. Every aspect (colors, sizes, mixing, and movement) is assigned to the process of minting, which makes every piece unique. Sit back, relax and give it time."
