  "description": "0/999 MintingÔºÅRaphael was born in Urbino, a small town in the province of Marche between Venice and Florence in northwest Italy, to a father who was a court painter for the Duke. Influenced by his father, Raphael developed a great interest in painting at a young age. He was a master of painting and architecture in the early years of the Renaissance in Italy, and was most admired for the Madonna of the Roman Vatican. His talent for absorbing whatever he sees, experiences, and is taught can be quickly transformed into his possession. Compared to Leonardo, Michelangelo and Titian, he was undoubtedly the most famous of his time."
