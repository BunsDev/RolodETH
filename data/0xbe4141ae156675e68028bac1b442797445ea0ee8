  "description": "Story Telling collection created by Manic Distopia inspired by growing up watching Tales from the crypt on HBO and reruns on Netflix of Twilight zone during the 21' Pandemic. I love short hard-hitting stories that make you think or laugh. There is not always a happy ending, but there is always a lesson somewhere to be learned. I started making 3D 5 months ago and have been learning real engine 5 for the past four months. It's an amazing program where I enjoy making cinematic animated 3d scenes.\n\nEach episode will break into three parts, a beginning, a middle, and an end called scenes. Full Episodes, which include all the scenes, are released on the 15th and 30th of each month.\n\nGOLD-3 episodes (9 Scenes)\nSilver- 5 episodes (15 scenes)\nDamascus- Every Episode (30 scenes)\n\nVenice 99' Holders receive 20% off on tokens until 10/1 \n(dM Manic on Twitter)\n\n[Season 1 Episode Calendar](https://doc.clickup.com/36218102/d/h/12h97p-320/e4c619d67831493)"
