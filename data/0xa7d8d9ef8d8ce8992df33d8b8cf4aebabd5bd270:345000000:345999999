  "description": "*3 Minute Meditations* is a set of audio/visual generative-art NFTs designed to provide the listener with a short, meditative experience.  Each *3MM* starts with a **unique fundamental frequency** and composes harmonics on top of it. One of these harmonics is a **binaural beat** that ends in the **delta** or **theta** band (associated with **mediation**, **deep** and **REM sleep**).  The others take shape as a combination of **constant and arpeggiated tones** to form an entrancing soundscape that moves through **temporary dissonance** into **climactic harmony**.  The associated visuals are representative of the sound, and follow a journey that mirrors the **sonic meditation**.\n\n** ***The focus of this piece is the audio, which must be enjoyed with headphones in order to properly realize its effects***. **\n\nListeners can watch the visuals as well, or close their eyes and **sink fully into the auditory experience**."
