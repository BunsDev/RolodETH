  "description": "The early settlers dubbed California The Golden State, and The Land of Milk and Honey. Today there are the obvious ironies – sprawl, spaghetti junctions and skid row—but the place is not so easily distilled or visualized, either as a cliched paradise or as its demise. There’s a strange kind of harmony when it’s all seen together—the sublime, the psychedelic, the self-destructive. Like all places, it’s unpredictable and contradictory, but to greater extremes. Cultures and histories coexist, the beautiful sits next to the ugly, the redemptive next to the despairing, and all under a strange and singular light, as transcendent as it is harsh.\n\n15% of all profits will be donated to Justice for Migrant Families, a non-profit organization supporting immigrant rights and immigrant families in need in the Buffalo, New York region.\nhttps://www.justiceformigrantfamilies.org/\n\nFellowship Studio"
