  "description": "Generic PFPs are a collection of 2,022, medium format, 2000px x 2000px PNGs. This collection of generic avatars are designed to act as neutral anti-profile-pictures. A placeholder for an identity that calls back to the stock avatars of old.\n\nThe 2,200 images are a subset of 125,000 possible variants. The colors and gradients used are hand-mixed, while the combinations are generated randomly using code. Mints are in multiples of two by default, with a maximum of two per wallet address. There is no mint fee."
