  "description": "Last of the 70s Pops, gone but not quite dead ðŸ‘» nothing but black & white groovy patterns, perfect for colouring in. Some people say the spirits of the 70s haunt these, but that would be ridiculous! All Îž from primary sales will be going to the Women Who Code non-profit organisation."
