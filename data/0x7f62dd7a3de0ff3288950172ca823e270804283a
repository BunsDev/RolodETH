  "description": "A community-driven collection of 1,111 brainy avatars created by a male and female artist who are also the co-founders of this project. The Brainiacs range from pastel feels in all layers such as backgrounds, bodies, brains, hats, eyes, mouth, and their clothing. Owning a Brainiac NFT allows its owner to contribute towards experiences and activations paid for by The Brainiacs Community Treasury. Each Brainiac also serves as an access pass to “Brainiacland” where high level keynote events take place featuring entrepreneurs, web3 enthusiasts, and representatives of well known brands both IRL and in the Metaverse."
