  "description": "On the Anniversary of Kobe’s passing our “Remembering Kobe” cheetah is a token of appreciation for one of the most dedicated and hardest working teams in the industry. \n\nOne of our favorite Kobe quotes is….\n\n\"The most important thing is to try and inspire people so that they can be great in whatever they want to do.\"\n\nAnd that's what the Coalition Crew is all about. We appreciate you all so much. Thank you for believing in our vision and we assure you this is only the beginning 💜💛\n\n#AirDropNumber1 #TheMambaMentality"
