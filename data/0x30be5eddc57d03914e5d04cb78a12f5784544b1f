He enjoys combining styles and techniques to convey ideas about the creative process. \n\nThe Worm is the first NFT that you share to mint. If you get The Worm and pass it along, it creates a copy of itself and leaves it in your wallet as proof that you helped The Worm along.\n\nFollow [@bryanbrinkman](https://twitter.com/bryanbrinkman).
