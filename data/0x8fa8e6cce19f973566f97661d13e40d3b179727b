  "description": "# MARNOTAUR  NFT Collection is on its way, from Dark Forest to Deep Space.\r\nMARNOTAUR  NFT Collection was conceived by the one-name liquidity protocol designed to multiply users’ experience in the DeFi world. \r\n\r\n# Stone Embryo → Mature Marnotaur\r\nWhen users buy a Marnotaur NFT, they are getting an embryo with unknown and unpredictable traits and looks. After transformation, the owners will finally see  character’s attributes - the fully-matured version of their Marnotaur.\r\n\r\n# Besides their artistic value, Marnotaur NFTs come with *multiple utilities* on the Marnotaur platform such as fully *upgradable Hero*, incl.  an owner ‘look-a-like’ feature. \r\n\r\nMade in collaboration with NFT256"
