  "description": "Enter the forest of Gozuki, where everything consists of greenery. The battle upfront starts with 4444 Gozuki's, all eager to start a legacy. They all have plans for heirs to their throne..\n\nThink of Orcs, Gremlins, Goblins, Swamp Beings, Reptiles and Nightcrawlers, basically everything that lives in the hidden mists.. \n\nThe Gozuki colours variate from Orcish Green to Mountain Greys. Each to have their own story and battle ahead. Next to that, the Gozuki's use old armor of fallen warriors, fishermen and peasants that tried to enter the forest but were simply not ready for what they were about to encounter.\n\nThe usage of Ethereum is strictly forbidden in the Forest, but some Gozuki's simply dont care..\nThey are also shunned from the forest, due to Ethereum holding dark forces.\n\nThere are also 11 1/1 Gozuki's scattered in the Forest. There is 1 Gozuki in particular, standing at 7 feet tall, where legend says that nobody has looked him in the eye for longer then 5 seconds.\n\n"
