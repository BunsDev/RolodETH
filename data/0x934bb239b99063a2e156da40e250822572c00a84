  "description": "Beginning with 5,555 Souls, Hikari is a collection of ‘initiates’ created by Jeez & ChainX.\r\n\r\nA soul’s energy can be transferred into an initiate and raised within the Gen-U experience. The resulting art is generated based on in-game decision data.\r\n\r\nHolders gain access to future collections, airdrops, comics, streetwear and playable characters within our MOBA: Legends of Hikari.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the home of the misfits.\r\n\r\n光"
