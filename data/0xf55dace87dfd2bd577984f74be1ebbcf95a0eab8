  "description": "This 1000-piece collection has been created to mark the historical moment of the Ethereum Merge in September 2022. It's a retrospection of the Proof of Work stage and a gesture to honour our community and partnerships sharing this milestone with us.\n\nThe coins were drawn and hand picked by [Zsolt Kosa](https://twitter.com/Zsoltkosa). Thanks to [Galaxis](https://galaxis.xyz/#/) to partnering up on this occasion."
