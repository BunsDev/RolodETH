  "description": "Inspired by classic, mind-bending mid century cartoons, Haywire Café uses distorted patterns and dramatic shadows to create a surreal, nostalgic vibe. \n\nHaywire Café endeavors to honor the masters of animation whose works were so deeply influential to me. This series combines sleek retro-futuristic elements with fluid, organic forms and bold colors to transport the viewer to a world where the laws of cartoon physics prevail. \n\nThe series is animated by default, but requires a desktop browser for best performance. Click to toggle the animation on or off."
