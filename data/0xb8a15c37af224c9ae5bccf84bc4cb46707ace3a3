  "description": "CryptoPoops are adorable mischievous NFTs generated live at the time of minting on the Ethereum blockchain! They come in all shapes and sizes, but theyâ€™re the kind of Poops you want to have around ðŸ˜˜\r\n\r\nThey're also the first NFTs to let 3rd party developers natively mint, burn, and \"re-roll\" users' traits using the exact same code from our smart contract. You might burn two commons to get a new more-rare at random...  Stake them in DeFi and once your interest is high enough, a new ðŸ’© is minted directly into your wallet... send them through a portal that might scramble their DNA or duplicate them... the possibilities are endless. If you'd like to build in the Poopiverse, reach out!"
