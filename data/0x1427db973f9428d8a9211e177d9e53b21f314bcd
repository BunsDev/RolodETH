  "description": "A Cryptoid is a one-of-kind interactive NFT: it is both a virtual pet and a decorating/collecting game that is directly playable on OpenSea. Each NFT is a cute creature that lives in its own garden. You must regularly take care of it to see it level up and evolve. By training and feeding your Cryptoid, you will gain XP and in-game coins that you can use to purchase new items. By doing so, you'll be able to make your inventory grow bigger and decorate your garden as you wish... The more items you collect, the rarer is your NFT!\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_Cryptoids\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://thecryptoids.io/"
