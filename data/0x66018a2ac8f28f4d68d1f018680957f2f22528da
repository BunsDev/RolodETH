  "description": "Using the IPFS technology, Etherland is connecting physical real estate and world places' data with a digital layer built on the Ethereum Blockchain. This virtual layer, or Etherland's Earth Metaverse, is displaying unique identity tokens for every real estate and place on Earth in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens named \"Land ID\".\n\nEach NFT representing a real place, also grants owners the control over the information linked to their token and stored on the IPFS network. On this Metaverse, users can use cryptocurrencies to buy, register, claim, create, promote, verify and monetize their Land ID tokens. Anyone is free to contribute in building the Etherland's World Metaverse."
