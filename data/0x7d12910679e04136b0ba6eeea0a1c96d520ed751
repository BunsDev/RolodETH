  "description": "Cheetah Cub Coalition is a collection of 7100 unique and adorable NFTs. That's one for every cheetah left in the wild, a shockingly low number. We've partnered with Born Free Foundation, a major UK charity, and will be adopting a real cheetah through them, for every NFT sold on our website.\r\n\r\nWe're here to make a huge impact on the world, but also to create an amazing community, with access to exclusive content, and an extensive roadmap."
