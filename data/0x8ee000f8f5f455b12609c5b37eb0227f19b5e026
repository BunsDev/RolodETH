  "description": "1,111 Players across 30 Countries enter the first ever on-chain Game of Risk. Trade to develop revenue for your country and place votes on which country should be banned from trading for 24 hours. After every 24 hours the highest volume country may vote to annex the lowest. Who will be left standing? Website launching soon. Each player may represent ONE country for free, or elect to buy access as a dual citizen."
