  "description": "Constellations - A collection of generative art that shows how our night sky could look like if planets and stars consist of other shapes. It began with a simple thought of what if stars and planets wasn't always spherical in shape?\n\nWhat if some planets was shaped like a cube? Or a cone? Or literally in a star shape? How do we express this thought in art form? Browsing through many artists and their works, along with staring at the evening sky from my apartment has given me inspiration for this genesis drop.\n\n---\n\nDrop #2 - [Perspective](https://opensea.io/collection/collective-168-perspective)"
