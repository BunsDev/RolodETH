  "description": "The Makaveli album was written, recorded and mastered in 7 days. Tupac was shot and died in 7 days. This collection commemorates the 25th anniversary of this album over 7 days with a different NFT dropped each day. Working with the artist who brought Tupacâ€™s vision for the design to life, Riskie Forever, this collection examines and reimagines the art to preserve an iconic album of hip-hop history. \n\n_(We have no affiliation with, and these NFTs have not been endorsed by, Amaru Entertainment, inc.
