  "description": "“One In The Same” is a collaboration between artist Amber Vittoria and her father, Giovanni Vittoria. This series of 5 paintings was born out of a bit of serendipity. The two of them realized their bond extended even further beyond their similar personalities and idiosyncrasies, when Amber noticed drawings in Gio's personal sketchbooks recalled much the same energy and spirit of Amber's own art. This spark ultimately led to a duet of paintings between Gio and Amber, in Amber’s signature style. She has noted this collection as the most meaningful collaboration of her life. Each painting is listed as a limited edition of 30 NFTs."
