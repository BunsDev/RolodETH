  "description": "A project where color is the language. Using a digital technique to allow the unconscious mind to express itself, my goal is to make the work look as realistic as possible, even if the scene itself contains impossible elements.\n\nSurrealism had a great effect on me because then I realised that the imagery in my mind wasn't insanity after all.\n\nWelcome to Surreal Lands"
