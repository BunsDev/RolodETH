  "description": "Welcome to the LAGO Pass on OpenSea. LAGO works directly with artists to create original NFTs exclusively for LAGO' Pass members. \r\n\r\nThe LAGO Pass is your access card to extraordinary experiences in the metaverse, in real-life – and beyond. The pass grants ownership of the luxe LAGO frame and access to the Founders' collective. After minting the LAGO Pass, holders will unlock exciting benefits unique to each member. These include artist drops, private events, impressive trips, and more. Perks will rotate monthly, offering each passholder diverse experiences in the metaverse and IRL.\r\nThe Founders’ Mint will release a limited number of LAGO Passes – 3,000 to be exact – with a small number reserved for early LAGO supporters."
