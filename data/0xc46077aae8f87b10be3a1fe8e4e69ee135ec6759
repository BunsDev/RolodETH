  "description": "The DRP member collection is a showcase of genesis artworks by artists we admire, reflecting our curatorial mission to serve as a bridge between technology and art.\n\nThe DRP membership token gives you access to web3 utility on the DRP platform and associated social media, as well as projects by our gallery and off-platform partners.\n\nWhile you only need to hold one token to gain full access to the site, acquiring the entire collection is not discouraged and utility created around full set ownership will be announced."
