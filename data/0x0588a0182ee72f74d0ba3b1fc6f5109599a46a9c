  "description": "Dorkis are dorks, goofballs and weirdos , created the old-fashioned way with pen and colored pencil on paper, scanned and edited to make 4724 randomly generated Dorkis. Each Dorkis character is a colorful, unique and weird avatar, with randomly selected hair, eyes, body and more.\n\nOur small team is a bunch of NFT dorks dedicated to NFTs and the NFT community. We're building an inclusive and diverse society - celebrating what makes us all unique dorks.\n\nWe Are Dorkis grant the owners of We Are Dorkis NFTs, a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to make, use and sell their Dorkis worldwide. \n\n[Evil Dorkis](https://opensea.io/collection/evildorkis)\n\n[Dorkis Airdrop System](https://opensea.io/collection/dorkis-drops)\n\n[Something Dorki](https://opensea.io/collection/something-dorki)"
