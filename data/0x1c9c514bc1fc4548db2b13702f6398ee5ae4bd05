  "description": "670 of the fiercest raiders ever known. These orcs have yet to ever meet their match. Judging by their ability to destroy everything in their sight, most doubt they ever will. \n\nThis collection features randomly generated orc and medieval styled attributes inlcuding skin tones, warpaints, earrings, necklaces, hairstyles, outfits, weapons, and highly detailed backgrounds! These all combine to give you the best looking NFTs money can buy!"
