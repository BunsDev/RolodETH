  "description": "The breathtaking beauty of the Mandelbrot Set - MandelNFT.com\n(new mathematical art NFT game coming soon [SpiroNFT.xyz](https://SpiroNFT.xyz) - 1000 free to MandelNFT holders)\n\nTo unlock the full 16MP image and also the exact Mandelbrot coordinates of your NFT, you must buy and have it in your wallet. This collection has **Zoom Depth** from *0* to *13*, which refers to a magnification of approximately 10 to the power of the **Zoom Depth**. Regarding traits and attributes, higher **Zoom Depth**s usually take longer to render and higher **File Size**s can indicate higher visual complexity.\n\nYou can now zoom within the vicinity (0.001 units any direction) of our NFTs in realtime to try to find it. You must own it to know the exact coordinates as we list them only approximately to the nearest 0.001 units.\n\neg. if you owned **NFT#446** you would be able to zoom straight into it: [Fractal Zoomer](https://mandelnft.com/FractalZoom/index.html?x=-1.0284578034276901&y=0.3614638718451996&NFT=446)"
