  "description": "Imagine a multidimensional and multitemporal space outside of reality, perhaps at the end of a black hole. Try to represent it with a code that transforms it into the changing variability of life, which encompasses all the nuances of human experience. This is Panelscape ðŸ…°ðŸ…±, a composition that changes in the alpha values of the panels. Try to find your space, the representation of reality that best suits you."
