  "description": "Helen Downie is a London based critically-acclaimed artist, best known for her idiosyncratic and expressive style of painting. Working under the moniker of UnskilledWorker, her paintings are both intimate and evocative, mixing characters and nature with the ephemeral and fantastical.  Downie’s work has attracted a large audience worldwide and has appeared in many international publications. Her paintings are collected nationally and internationally and have been exhibited at galleries across the worldi. In 2015, the artist was commissioned by the Italian fashion house Gucci to make a series of portraits for exhibition at the Minsheng Art Museum in Shanghai and created the Unskilled Worker collection for Gucci, as well as a special work exclusively for Gucci.com.  She was chosen as one of seven leading contemporary women artists by Bazaar Art, which featured one of her portraits as the cover of its annual collectors’ edition. "
