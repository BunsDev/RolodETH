  "description": "BoneHeadz is a collection of 5,000 freely minted and upgradeable NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain. Every BoneHead was minted for free and grants access to tomb raiding. Holders pay a small toll to raid a tomb, collect loot & upgrade their NFTs or die trying every season. The players with the most loot at the end of the season collect their share of the ETH prize pool."
