  "description": "The Compass Medallion were given to all members of the clandestine Operation Compass. Operating outside the regular Protocol chain of command and support structures, Operation Compass was ultimately deemed a total loss. Medallions have been recovered from the fallen members of the operation and awarded to the small group of recruits found by CJ.0111.\n\nGold Compass Medallions were awarded to conductors and the Emporium support personnel assigned to their operation."
