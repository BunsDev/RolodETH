  "description": "Where My Vans Go is a collection comprised of 125 iconic images created over the span of three years exploring all over the United States.  From coast to coast, between borders and beyond, this series represents the journey that has forged the person and artist that I am today. By following my vans on this vast journey through time, I hope you will feel every step and heartbeat, I hope you will rise above fears with me.  If this journey has taught me anything it is that everything is about our struggle and process, if you never climb, you never see the view.  This is the climb.  In snow and fog, sunshine and rain, from the tops of skyscrapers and bridges and through incarceration, here I learned to do whatever it takes.  These are the shoes that made me. Welcome."
