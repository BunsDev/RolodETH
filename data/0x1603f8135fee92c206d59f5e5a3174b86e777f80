  "description": "[FOUNDATION LINK](https://foundation.app/collection/strangeparadise)\nSome of it will feel familiar—like your toothbrush’s hairdo or the cracks you pass on your way to work—and then it won’t. The sublime is closer than it appears. Art is a bridge. In 2014, when everyone woke up with a camera in their pocket and we left our analogue selves for good, New York Artist Charlie Rubin made a book visualizing that change in culture. Now these thoughts have a permanent sanctuary. You’re welcome to stay as long as you want.\n\n**This NFT Collection is accompanied by a [Virtual Exhibition in New Art City](http://tinyurl.com/crubin2)**\n\n---\n\n*Artist: Charlie Rubin\nEdition: 1/1\nWorks Created 2012-2022; NFT digitally minted in 2022*\n\nFor more info: [charlierubin.com](http://tinyurl.com/crubin1)\n\n*[All links active at time of creation, 2022]*\n\n♥"
