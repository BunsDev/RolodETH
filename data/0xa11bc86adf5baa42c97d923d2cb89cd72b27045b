  "description": "Deployed on August 7, 2015, testContract is one of the first smart contracts on Ethereum. It does nothing besides print \"Hello Ethereum!\". \n\nUntil now, no one has spent any gas interacting with this contract. These 1,000 souvenier tokens are each the result of spending a bit of gas to interact with testContract. The first 1,000 interactions are HISTORIC and deserve to be memorialized."
