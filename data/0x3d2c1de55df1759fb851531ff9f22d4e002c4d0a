  "description": "The premier collection of  1/1 Wave Art on the blockchain by Kim Feast \n\nSalt Water is a collection of ocean art born from a lifetime of ocean experience in some of the most extreme and pristine environments on the planet. Combined with a love of documenting the world around me with my camera, these stunning moments often require a risk to my safety to create and like any beautiful waves in the ocean are fleeting, unique and cannot be replicated."
