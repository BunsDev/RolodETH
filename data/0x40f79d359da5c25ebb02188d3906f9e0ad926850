  "description": "time&_ (time and space) is created by using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm to model electromagnetic ripples in a simulate universe. nomenclature built the collection in celebration of the complexity and beauty of math, bringing to light the forces that form everything we see and touch. Future series by them will focus on the same theme.\n\n500 animated items were originally minted, 190 of which have since been burned to improve the collection's quality and scarcity. Updates and details about future Rithm series will be released on twitter and in the discord.\n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/nomenclature-timeandspace"
