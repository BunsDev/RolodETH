  "description": "Daniel Arsham is a contemporary American visual artist who works across art, architecture, and performance. His work has been shown in museums and institutions worldwide, including MoMA PS1 and the New Museum, New York among others. He is the subject of a solo exhibition at Musée Guimet in Paris, and a forthcoming solo show at UCCA Dune in July 2021. Arsham’s work was also recently included in The National Gallery of Victoria’s NGV Triennial 2020.\r\n\r\nSince 2013, Daniel has developed a highly successful edition practice with global reach, becoming one of the key leaders in this space. His releases often sell out immediately, resulting in exponential secondary market results on StockX and at auction houses such as Sotheby's. Arsham has also collaborated with the likes of Adidas, Dior, Pharrell Williams, and Pokémon."
