  "description": "Tozzi Ducks is an experimental NFT project from artist Jim Tozzi (Wonder Showzen, Xavier: Renegade Angel) and Chain/Saw. The core collection consists of 200 on-chain pixel-art ducks created by Jim. Minting happens through our virtual duck-dispenser: The Tozzi Duck Machine  ([tozziducks.fun](https://tozziducks.fun/)). \n\nWe've packed a ton of features into the machine: name your duck, fill out its profile, draw and mint a custom on-chain duck, or buy the whole damn machine and start your own duck business! We've NFTized the entire machine, allowing ownership (and all associated powers) to be transferred just like any ERC-721 token.\n\nTo kick things off, we're auctioning off some custom ducks created by a roster of amazing artists: eBoy, Gremplin, Jen Stark, Killer Acid, Matt Furie, Takeshi Murata, Sterling Crispin, Ellie Pritts, Sky Goodman, NoPattern, Christian Rex van Minnen, Yoshi Sodeoka, Jimmy Edgar, and Christy Karacas.\n\nStay tuned & join us on Discord for more release details!"
