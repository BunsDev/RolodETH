  "description": "Inspired by fond childhood memories, Bingo! takes a timeless, luck-based game and adds a strategic twist with a burn-to-merge contract mechanism. Collect enough boards to get bingo, or go even further to see your board evolve. Cells in each minted board are randomly filled in and from there, boards can be merged - two into one - by burning. The resulting board will have the union of cells filled in from the merged boards and new, random styling. The supply will deflate as boards are merged. Happy playing!"
