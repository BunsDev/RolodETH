  "description": "\"Foliage\" is a moment of pause. The project is born from the futile attempt to catch a breath of wind, the one that no one sees but everyone notices when the leaves hang trembling. Inspired by long days near the Rio de la Plata studying the wind, this series of 625 foliage is an exploration of how angles and colors can generate the illusion of movement and harmony. \"Foliage\" is inspired on wind data visualizations where the use of angles and vectors speak of a trajectory. Winds, like data, travel through our world leaving a trace;  this time hosted immutably on the Ethereum Blockchain."
