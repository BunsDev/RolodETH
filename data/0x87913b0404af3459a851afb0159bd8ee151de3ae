  "description": "More than a documentary record of New York City, nyc365 is a fantastical view of the beauty, contrast, grit, glow and rhythm of the city, full of surrealism, abstraction, impressionism, cubism and realism- all the major art movements seem to be represented by one photographer in one grand collection of photography of this magnificent city."
