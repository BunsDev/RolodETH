  "description": "== Redemption of Flying Formations NFTs has begun and will continue through June 30. == If the redemption claim for physical shoes is important to you, we STRONGLY ADVISE that bidders do not use standing bids on this marketplace, there is a risk that a bad faith seller could redeem their NFT and immediately accept a standing bid for that NFT. Those interested in trading unredeemed NFTs are strongly encouraged to engage directly on the Flying Formations official Discord == Flying Formations is the first series in the  Ducks of a Feather project. It is a limited-edition series of 120 one-of-a-kind NFTs created by Tinker Hatfield to benefit University of Oregon Duck Athletes. It represents the initial offering from “Ducks of A Feather” by Division Street, an ongoing marketing initiative featuring University of Oregon athletes. Featuring a complementary pair of Air Max 1 UO Edition sneakers designed by Tinker. "
