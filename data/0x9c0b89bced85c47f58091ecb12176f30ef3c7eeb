  "description": "The commune is an anti-commune that is an experiment on experimental arts, and cultural data curation thereof. \n\nThe initial distribution was a free mint. This is a personal attempt at creating a chat-room venue for those who are interested in experimental sonic arts. \n\nThere is no DAO, nor will be any.\n\nThis is not an investment club, this is just a hangout haven. Act accordingly."
