  "description": "The CrypToadettez are a collection of 6969 NFTâ€™s living on the Ethereum blockchain created by female artist and co-founder Girlz Wrld. The Toadettez are in search of their long-lost male counterparts, the CrypToadz. They have had time to be badass Toadettez without them for quite some time, so the time has come to be reunited. With that being said, we recognize the importance of being strong, independent Toadettez and have multiple initiatives towards supporting women in the NFT space as well as outside of it, through resources and proceeds obtained from our exciting project."
