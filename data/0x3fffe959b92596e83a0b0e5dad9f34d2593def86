  "description": "Assplosion is a collection of 5,000 explosive birds. When you get a bird you will earn an ASSplosion try. \nThat means you can try to blow the ass off of a random bird. \n\nBut calm down, you will only have a 50% success ratio, which means only 2,500 birds will explode (and their respective artworks will change automatically).\n\nAnnouncement JUNE 8TH, turn on Twitter notifications: https://twitter.com/assplosionwtf"
