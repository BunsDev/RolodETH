Upon seeing there were still pure-hearted individuals, aliens decided to protect mankind, but not everyone agreed. The decision split up aliens into two sides â€“ one wanting to protect, led by Primolien, and the other wanting to destroy humans led by Alientron.\n\nGet your Enemes ready for the most epic clash of your lives while you gain exclusive access to meets, IRL events, merch, and further roadmap versions. Climb aboard this fast-moving spaceship and let that imagination run wild!"
