  "description": "Iterating on Bad Cache, Restored Cache is a generative series of artworks that involve the collector. The artworks are created with a feedback loop initiated from the outputs of Bad Cache. The program makes ten attempts to recreate the original tokens; each iteration is fed back into the program to create a new output."
