  "description": "Majestic flying creatures living far away to the Northeast of Bunker 2171. \n\nEach element of the collection DraGONS is able to claim 1 $AMBER per day for a period of 2171 days.\n$AMBER is the utility token of the Bunker2171 ecosystem. It is NOT an investment and has NO economic value. \n$AMBER tokens are a means by which users may activate the Alien Kimera Protocol and may purchase digital/physical items exclusively inside our ecosystem. Bunker2171 is built to be a community-driven project.\n\n5th of 6 collections by Bunker 2171\n\nMutantKongz https://opensea.io/collection/mutantkongz  \nGorilla Nemesis https://opensea.io/collection/gorillanemesis  \nBunker Chronicles https://opensea.io/collection/bunkerchronicles  \nBunker Beasts https://opensea.io/collection/bunkerbeasts  \nDraGONS https://opensea.io/collection/dragons2171  \nAlien Kimera Protocol https://opensea.io/collection/alienkimeraprotocol  "
