  "description": "GardenScapes Mint live at: https://www.evosnails.com/\n2000 available to mint at 0.1 ETH each. BUILD, BREED, PROTECT, ATTACK and EXPAND your empire in the GardenVerse!\n\nGardenScapes Official Opensea: https://opensea.io/collection/evosnails-gardenscape/\n\nThere are currently over 4000 snails staked.  All of the staked snails are being held in the staking wallet. This means that the number of holders on OpenSea does not reflect the true number of holders.\n\nEvoSnails are a fully on-chain open source NFT project that allows users to stake their snails and upgrade snail traits. Once upgraded, snails will race on the 3rd of December to compete for prizes. Does slow and steady really win the race?"
