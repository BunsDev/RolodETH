  "description": "The morning before the earthquake hit, a group of Sevens were spotted raving on the beach, not far from The Void, blissfully unaware of what was going to happen on the very ground they were standing on. They thought they were alone, but were they, really?\n\nThe lore of the Sevens universe is expanding and new faces are coming into the fray. Friend or foe, you'll find out soon enough. Come and be part of the second Sevens collection."
