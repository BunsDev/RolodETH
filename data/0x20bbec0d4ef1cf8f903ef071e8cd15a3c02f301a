  "description": "Jamet is an iconic figure known for his dance that rebalances the ETH Network, a hand-drawn collection of NFTs, containing 3333 individually generated NFT supplies. Started as a meme project with pixelated PFP, Jamet is now expanding into a line art-style PFP project with inhuman elements within it. By bringing up Jamet folklore as the main theme, this project will connect all Jamets around the world and mold them into a strong Web3 community."
