  "description": "ARCHETYPES is a continuously evolving AI collection by N8. Unsold works randomly evolve over time. Multiple-edition holders are airdropped synthesized/remixed works. This collection explores what art means when genres are combined, aesthetics are synthesized, and how a work's meaning can change when its form is constantly in flux. \n\nARCHETYPES explores the idea that AI art engages with the collective consciousness of all of art history so far. Through combining the aesthetics of artists both living and dead, what kinds of essential & universal symbols emerge?"
