  "description": "This is collection minted as life happens.\n\nI balance between camping in the woods, and walking city streets. I'm nowhere some days, and everywhere on others. Hiding in nature I find the most beautiful personal experiences. Sleeping on suburban streets, I find thought provoking scenes.\n\nI am compelled to keep seeing the US this way, photographing and writing. These memories will live here forever, these are visions from a road trip."
