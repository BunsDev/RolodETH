  "description": "Freedom Flowers are symbols of gratitude and love for those helping to shape the cultural and technological revolution in NFT communities around the world. Collectors are supporting digital literacy education. \n\nPortions of the proceeds raised from the NFT sales, will be donated to Girls Who Code, a non-profit organization working to close the gender gap in technology. Their programs educate and inspire girls with the skills they'll need to pursue 21st century opportunities.\n\nFreedom flowers are part of a larger “Know Your Digital Rights” educational platform.  They are featured in an immersive short film experience in the \"Walled Garden\" metaverse centered around the concept of a Declaration of Digital Independence and a Digital Bill of Rights. \n\nLearn more at: https://zcreativemedia.tv/freedomflowers"
