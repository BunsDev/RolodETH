  "description": "30 Editions minted at https://heds.io on 2/12/2022. The original sample submitted by Sober Rob serves as the genesis sample for this visual mixtape. Every artist on the tape, curated by heds, has at least one second of the sample in their submission. Public submissions opened the door for artists who we believe deserve exposure in web3. We've saved several slots on the tape for these talented individuals. Each NFT is a 10 minute visual mixtape that accompanies the audio."
