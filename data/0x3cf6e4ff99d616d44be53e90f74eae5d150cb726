  "description": "The very first NFT artworks by Alejandro and Taylor. \n\nThese early works were minted for 0.02 eth each back before Alejandro and Taylor released their first collections (https://opensea.io/collection/mirage-gallery). \n\nAlejandro and Taylor each released 5 pieces and there were able to be 100 copies of each. But the minting ended early since they didn't all mint in time. "
