  "description": "CHECK BOX BEFORE BUYING! SOME HAVE BEEN OPENED! Check at [our website](https://rarepizzas.com/store). See what the pizzas inside are like on [their OpenSea collection](https://opensea.io/collection/rare-pizzas).\n\nRare Pizzas is a collection of 10,000 unique generative art pizzas sold on a curve that ends at 10,000 Bitcoin, an homage to Laszlo's purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoin on May 22nd in 2010, the first recorded cryptocurrency transaction for real-world goods. \n\nOwning a box entitles the holder to order one pizza of the recipe of their choice at [our website](https://rarepizzas.com/store). Each pizza is rendered on demand and topped with a random assortment of toppings from the 314 artists that each contributed a topping.\n\nEach sale funds the purchase of real-world pizzas to throw a global pizza party on Bitcoin Pizza Day, May 22nd. We spent $330k on pizza on 5/22/21, help us spend more next year! Visit [our website](https://rarepizzas.com/) for more details. "
