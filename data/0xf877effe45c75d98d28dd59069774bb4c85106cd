  "description": "ANG3LS X D3MONS is the collaborative project between artists Jake Zelinger and Twick. ANG3LS X D3MONS toys with the juxtaposition of striking symbols and imagery to evoke a subtle narrative within each individual piece. When viewed together, these pieces blend to create the larger narrative of these iconic mythical beings and their seemingly forced inhabitance of the physical world. Some thrive, while others despair. Welcome to the brainchild of Twick and Jake Zelinger - ANG3LS X D3MONS"
