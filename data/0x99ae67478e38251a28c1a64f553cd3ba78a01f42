  "description": "A tribe of 3333 CyberGorillas have worked secretly within the Jungle to develop a powerful JungeSerum. Upon consumption, a Baby CyberGorilla will be produced. Part of our P2E ecosystem.\n\nYour NFTs may accumulate a utility token (“GRILLA”) when they are staked in the smart contract. GRILLA has no other functionality other than within the Cyber Gorillas ecosystem, and it cannot be purchased from Cyber Gorillas Developers. The Cyber Gorillas Developers do not provide or intend to provide a secondary marketplace for GRILLA."
