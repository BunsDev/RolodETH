  "description": "The year is 2050. A next-generation group of \"beasts\" have come across Earth. They are the first group of super-naturals to arrive on the planet. After only 11 days, humans have become completely extinct. As they assert their dominance across Earth, they discover the remains of what humans have created-- 200,000 years of their work, to be exact. This is their story.\n\nTier Zero: Beasts is a collection of 10,000 NFTsâ€”unique AI generated digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain (stored as ERC-721 tokens and hosted on IPFS)"
