  "description": "  If you own the 10 ETH Giveaway Token, then go to https://10eth.0ms.co/redeem and click the \"REDEEM\" button to receive 10 ETH! No tricks. No scams. No games. Just 10 ETH directly in your wallet. And you only need to own this one NFT to get it. Hi, I'm Steve Pikelny. And I want to give you 10 ETH of my hard earned money. That's right. You heard me correctly. I have 10 ETH just lying around with your name written all over it. That's 10 big, fat, juicy Ethers. All for redeeming a simple NFT. 100% Guaranteed. Don't believe me? Take a look at the smart contract. When I told my lawyers, accountants, and top business advisors what I wanted to do, they said: \"Steve! Are you crazy?! Doing this would be financial suicide!\"But I didn't get to where I am today by playing it safe. What my advisors don't know is that from a business standpoint, this is a no-brainer. "
