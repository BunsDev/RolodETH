  "description": "The Louvre, located on the North Bank of the Seine River in the center of Paris, France, ranks first among the four major museums in the world. Founded in 1204, it was originally the Royal Palace of France, where 50 French kings and queens lived. It is one of the most precious buildings in the period of French classicism and is famous for its rich collection of classical paintings and carvings. It is now the Louvre Museum, covering an area of about 198 hectares. It is divided into new and old parts. The pyramid shaped glass entrance in front of the palace covers an area of 24 hectares. It was designed by the Chinese architect I.M. Pei. On August 10, 1793, the Louvre Museum of art officially opened to the public and became a museum. The Louvre has become a world-famous art palace, one of the largest art treasures, and a world-famous palace of treasures."
