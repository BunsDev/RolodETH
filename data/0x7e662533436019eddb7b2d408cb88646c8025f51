  "description": "SHOOT PORTRAITS NOT PEOPLE is the brainchild of photographer and sculptor Jason Siegel. The 2017 inception of this project came out of a desire to reprogram the mind and inform a notion of anti-violence. The concept of \"shooting\" is synonymous with both guns and photography, a strange duality when considering that guns destroy and cameras create. It is at the intersection of these two ideas that Jason started sourcing and building these physical gun sculptures out of recycled camera equipment. Seen in numerous installations across the United States, and in the homes of collectors around the world; It is with great pride and excitement that this project moves from the physical world into the metaverse.\n\n-\n\nThe NFTs in this collection consist of the photographs that correspond with the physical sculptures created over the lifespan of the project. Photographed by Siegel himself, each NFT will be minted in limited editions, with 1/1s and collaborative pieces available soon.\n\n"
