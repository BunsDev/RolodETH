THE REAL OWNER COUNT AS OF 05/15/22 IS 400. **\n\nOn-chain landlords compete to grow their real estate portfolio and earn $CASH. Novel deflationary mechanics.\n\nSave up $CASH to acquire more properties, use $CASH to purchase whitelist spots for hyped projects and raffle tickets for high value NFTs in our marketplace. Compete against other landlords on a weekly basis for a prize pool.\n\nWebsite: https://house.game\nPlay: https://play.house.game\nWhitepaper: https://medium.com/@housegamenft/house-game-whitepaper-8f8dc75e62a6"
