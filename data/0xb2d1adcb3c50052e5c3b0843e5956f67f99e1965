Hotspins, tokens based on the ERC-721 standard, are used to verify ownership on the Ethereum network. Hotspins are not your typical online community; it actually helps people in over 150 casinos worldwide. You have complete control over this spin machine, determining all of the rules.\r\n\r\nThere are no two Hotspins NFTs alike, and their rarity varies.
