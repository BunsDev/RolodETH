  "description": "No matter how shitty the world is, every moment of life is a gift, including the Carbon Dioxide you just led out got its own use. These 3000 fishing guys are not just a collection of PFPs, but the bait for your future profits. We don't need to weave moving stories for them, because stories are just stories, what we make is the future."
