  "description": "Convicted Squirrels is a collection of 1202 Generation 1 Squirrel NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nThese innocent squirrels were convicted without a fair trial. Luckily for them they were bailed out by brave NFT collectors.  \n\nOwning a squirrel is not only good for your karma, it has even more benefits. Owning a squirrel grants you access to holder incentive programs like 'Sharing the Soap' and it gets you prime access to  upcoming drops. \n\nWhich upcoming drops? Glad you asked! Check out the [Zombie Squirrels](https://discord.gg/SquirrelsNFT).\n\n[Website](https://convictedsquirrels.com) · [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SquirrelsNFT) · [Discord](https://discord.gg/SquirrelsNFT) ·"
