  "description": "This NFT is a one of a kind, animated illustration by Tristan Eaton. Made in 2021, for the historic Christie's x NFTNOW exhibition & auction, this piece was Eaton's first 1/1 NFT, his first NFT auction and the first NFT on his own personal contract on the blockchain. From the artist:\n\n\"This digitally illustrated moving image depicts a common human trait: optimism in the face of total destruction. Wether as a coping mechanism in the face of actual war or a defense mechanism within inter-personal relationships, the human ability to channel hope and optimism allows us to channel super human powers. Overcoming giant obstacles and facing down the unspeakable horrors of the human experience are only possible with this precious human trait.\""
