  "description": "THANKYOUX\r\n\r\nInspired by the pop tropes and bright colors of the NYC graffiti scene, ThankYouX graduated from LA street stencils to paintings and sculpture exhibitions in London, LA, Miami, NY and Hong Kong. Now using his street style in a more unique way, he has gained attention for his geometric mixed media cube paintings and large scale abstract work.\r\n\r\nJN SILVA\r\n\r\nNew York street photographer JN Silva (aka Jose Silva) is on a quest to be a modern day Renaissance Man, a goal he tackles one day at a time. Born and raised in Caracas, Venezuela, he now calls West New York, NJ home and exercises his passion for the urban, the energetic, and the colorful through his work."
