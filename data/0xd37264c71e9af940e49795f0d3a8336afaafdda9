  "description": "Born from the ashes of a rug; carried on the backs of unexpected holders who shared a vision and simply refused to give up—JungleBay Ape Club is the first project of its kind—100% community built.\n\nAgainst all odds: With every surprise expense, speed bump, disagreement, scam attempt and multitude of other external forces that tried to derail us, our community's resilience remained and continues to be laser-focused on building together.\n\nIt’s common for projects to boast a strong, dedicated community. However, JungleBay  has established the blueprint for a true community project. From rug, to DAO, to art development, to mint out, land acquisition in the Sandbox, tokenomics/staking, leadership election, Otherside Land acquisition, $APE investment of 10% of our Treasury, weekly community events and a vibrant voice chat, and more, this community has become a growing family of Degens. Join us!"
