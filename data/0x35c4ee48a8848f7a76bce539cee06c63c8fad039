  "description": "ALTARS are said to be the medial space between worlds. Across spiritual traditions, they are where dimensions - the upper and lower, the heavens and earth, the underworld… - meet. A place where lines are blurred. A medial state, the in between: portals to something different and unknown. The longer you sit in reverence before an ALTAR, the more it will reveal to you. And the more you will realize how much there is left to know…\r\n\r\nALTARS is a first-of-its-kind abstract generative project by visual artist & writer Alex (amac) Maceda. ALTARS is a collaboration between canvas and code; a project that blends physical and digital and invites you to choose not either/or, but both."
