  "description": "THIS CONTRACT has been MIGRATED.\r\n\r\n- New contract has been deployed, all the KamaGang V1 holder has been sent their exact Kamas at KamaGang V2 [https://opensea.io/assets/thekamagang](https://opensea.io/assets/thekamagang)\r\n\r\n- This old contract will be pointing to NULL, so the images/traits from your old KAMAs will be gone as soon as OpenSea takes action. \r\n\r\n- Contacted Opensea to eliminate and delete the old collection.\r\n\r\n- All the excess payers from Tier 2 have been 0.1 ETH refunded. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow a new era starts with our team breaking the taboos and barriers!! \r\nWe took the matters in our own hands and undid to wrongs we made.\r\nWe've eliminated the bonding curve.  The only curves we want now are the ones we can run our hands up and down!\r\n\r\n[https://opensea.io/assets/thekamagang](https://opensea.io/assets/thekamagang)"
