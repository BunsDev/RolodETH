  "description": "Rockaway's Trash explores the aberration of seaside littering, and my visceral feelings for seeing it on the beaches of New York City. I do not aim for shaming, environmental soapbox standing, or preaching for how we should carry out our own garbage. Let's be real, it all winds up in landfills, and how is that any better?\n\nRather than display the obvious: overflowing bins of garbage, I want viewers to look, absorb, and come to their own conclusions."
