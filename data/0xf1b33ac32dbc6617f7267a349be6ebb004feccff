  "description": "As the first release from Bitlectro Labs, Dreamloops feature programmatically generated 8-bit musical loops and 16-bit artwork produced by Keil Corcoran of the band STRFKR. 1 in 5 Dreamloops (20%) will be redeemable for physical media (vinyl record or cassette tape). The ‘album covers’ are inspired by classic gaming platforms such as the Amiga, PC98, and Super Nintendo, featuring a retro-futuristic aesthetic. The music for each Dreamloop is composed entirely on a classic NES using a MIDINES cartridge. Each Dreamloop's music and art is unique and features elements of varying scarcity. Dreamloops are minted in a ‘wrapped’ state like a pack of collectible cards or a gift until “unwrapped” using the unwrap feature at bitlectrolabs.com. The owner of each Dreamloop receives a Creative Commons CC BY-ND license for their musical loop and a CC BY license for the visual composition to use as they see fit.  Unwrap your Dreamloops at https://bitlectrolabs.com"
