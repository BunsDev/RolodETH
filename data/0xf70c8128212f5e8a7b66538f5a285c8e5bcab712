  "description": "We're from the 2056 Federation of Solar System Creators, codenamed EAR, responsible for creating virtual objects in the real world. Our mission is to travel back in time to 2022 and bring back future equipments to create more possibilities for the human multiverse timeline. We were a bunch of cute meta-cosmic geeks, a bunch of daydreamers, sometimes weirdo, but good at games and math. This is our first project - “Dawn”. “Dawn” is an outer body armor series that starts with a jetpack, as this is the prototype series for solo geek gear in 2056."
