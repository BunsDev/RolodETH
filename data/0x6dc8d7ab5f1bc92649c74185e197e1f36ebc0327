  "description": "Long time forward on a planet far away...\nThere was a town where creatures lived.\nCANDYTOWN. It is a seaside town located in a warm, natural area.\nWe can hear someone's tweets and cheerful songs around.\nEat a variety of sizzling fruits and vegetables.\nIt's always filled with happy conversations\nand a peaceful, friendly atmosphere.\nEveryone has been through a lot.\nThere should have been many hard times in each past.\n\"But from now on, we can live cheerfully and happilly.\"\nMAATs all believe that. They are living hard and happy every day."
