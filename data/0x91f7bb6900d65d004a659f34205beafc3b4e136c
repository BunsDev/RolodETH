  "description": "Hey! If you are looking for virgin Birbs, check their status using https://www.derpybirbs.com/search or shop for them on https://www.derpybirbs.com/shop\n\nThe Story starts with 8192 Birbs of the finest quality, born after years of sketches and drawings made by the talented Artist in our team. Each Birb is assembled from a pool of traits with different rarities that are assigned programmatically and stored on IPFS. No one knows where they came from, but like most Birbs, they like to lay eggs that will hatch into new and surprising assets!\n\nGen2+ Collection: https://opensea.io/collection/derpy-birbs-next-generations"
