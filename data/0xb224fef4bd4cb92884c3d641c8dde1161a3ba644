  "description": "Future Artworks. These NFTs encapsulate the right to commission my artwork at no cost within the next 40 years, regardless of the current value of my art. This is an art statement, an investment, whatever you want it to be.\n\nProceeds from the token sale are being used to fund my tuition at the New York Academy of Art.\n\nCollectors will follow the entire creative journey during my tuition at NYAA via monthly live sessions on [leam.xyz](https://leam.xyz)."
