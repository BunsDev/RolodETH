  "description": "Lingerie Girl NFTs are the first NFTs that will be put on auction out of the MaidCoin ecosystem.\n[Details](https://medium.com/maid-coin/introducing-lingerie-girl-nft-auction-d7a65522a2c7)\n\nIn terms of their power levels, these are weaker than Maids but are stronger than Sushi Girls that we’re giving away for $MAID-WETH LP holders. Lingerie Girls go under the category of Housekeeper NFTs and actually and these are the strongest ones in that category.\n\nOn OpenSea, it’s not possible to use $MAID as the payment token, thus they’ll be sold in ETH just like most of other NFTs. After the auction is over, half of the ETH revenue will be swapped into $MAID and together with the another half, they will be added as liquidity to SushiSwap’s $MAID-WETH pool."
