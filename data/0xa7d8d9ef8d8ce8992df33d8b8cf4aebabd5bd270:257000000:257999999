  "description": "Zoom in, zoom out. Machine Comics is an experiment in generative storytelling, an abstract graphic novel drawn by an algorithm and revealed as it is minted. Paying homage to pop art and classic comic book aesthetics, saturated colors and halftone dots create unexpected patterns and vibrant textures in each unique page. The plot is yours to project, dear reader. What do you see?"
