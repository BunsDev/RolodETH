  "description": "Degenning is an art that many project creators don't understand.  \nWe paper hands their projects because they forget the most important:  \n**\"Bring more value to your holders and they won't sell.\"**  \nWe are doing high risk investments bringing most of the projects to life.  \nWe are the first to sell before the bubbles explode. Yeah, profit is profit and we assume it.  \nWe are hyper active and breathe the market trends even if the bear market impacts our income.  \n**50% of all royalties are paid weekly to our ApeHODLers (HODL for an eternity of 7 days to be eligible)**  \nNo discord, no bullshit, just an outstanding vision. Let's get rewarded!\n"
