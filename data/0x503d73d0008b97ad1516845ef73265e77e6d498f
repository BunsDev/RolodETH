  "description": "Tsubasa（翼）, \"A Pair of Wings\" in Japanese, is the Symbol of Freedom, also the name of KIKI's best human friend. Tsubasa is a record label, a fashion brand, free, non-binary, healing, supporting Animal Charity, Artists, and Mental Health. Our love and passion are our wings, to break barriers, remove labels, abandon stereotypes, to understand, to feel, to love, to build a utopia for everyone to be our true selves, and create a free world that belongs to all, regardless of language, culture, gender, race, religion, class, and species."
