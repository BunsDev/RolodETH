  "description": "Limited set of 20 unique 1/1 images taken in Afghanistan in 2019. Sold to raise money for the non-profit EMERGENCY in Afghanistan. Photography by [Glen Wilde](https://www.instagram.com/glenwildephoto/).\n\n100% of proceeds and all royalties ongoing will be donated to EMERGENCY who are providing vital healthcare on the ground right now... [https://en.emergency.it/what-we-do/afghanistan/](https://en.emergency.it/what-we-do/afghanistan/)\n\nAfghanistan is a stunningly beautiful place geographically and the people I met were incredibly warm and welcoming. They don’t want this and they don’t deserve this.\n\nA few notes on the collection... I've minimised many details regarding the trip, locations and anyone I knew in country. There's a very reasonable fear at this stage that the Taliban will dig into people's online lives. I knew no one in these shots, other than to ask for a photo.\n\nThank-you for viewing and thank-you for your support!\n"
