  "description": "Accepting offers of 0.256 Îž \n\nREVELATIONS is a series of 256 works by Travis LeRoy Southworth that explores moments of quiet absurdity to existential crisis linked to the growing marketplace of algorithms and artistic production. Southworth uses text and image to reveal shifting sentiments and further question how the tools we use attribute to digital identity and social relationships. \n\nThe process of making each work derives from the belief that in order to be seen, we have to exhibit the predictability and consistency of algorithms. But as much as we crave the reliability of a protocol, the results often create unintelligible output. Paradoxically, as the algorithm itself attempts to become more human we become less so.\n\nValues not rarities. While works do include a type of property, I consider these aspects as additional details to the story. You must decide what is of value.\n\nContract: Manifold.\nImages: 3000x4000px JPGs\nStored on Arweave with metadata. \n"
