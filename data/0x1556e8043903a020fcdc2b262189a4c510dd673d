  "description": "RITUALS is a generative music and artwork project by Aaron Penne and Boreta celebrating emergence, mindfulness, and community. This Art Blocks Factory project binds collectors to the generative work at the moment of its creation by revealing and minting the first 200 pieces individually in-person (IRL) at Bright Moments Gallery in Venice, CA.\n\nYou can only mint once and must be in-person to unlock your RITUALS NFT during your assigned mint time on the weekend of September 24th - September 26th, 2021.\n\nOwning a Golden Token: Rituals Venice (GTRV) NFT provides you with a claim to mint a RITUALS NFT during this weekend event. A GTRV token is not redeemable for a RITUALS NFT after 9/26/2021. See more details here: https://www.ritualsirl.com/"
