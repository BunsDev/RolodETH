  "description": " \t- **Super Space Defenders** is an upcoming NFT Collection consisting of 8,888 cloned individuals with different personalities, political affinities and styles, living in a reality where the human species is only a memory in the history books. The solar system is now inhabited by the Aurora Sapiens, biological duplicates with synthetic additives from Subject #8,888 Aurora, the only human whose genetic code managed to be replicated.\n\n \t- They’re mainly divided in two groups: The Elites and The Citizens. The Elites are a group of wealthy Families that govern the galaxy, while the Citizens are the workforce of the galaxy, living under the Elite’s rules. But... it's time for some changes, isn't it?!\n\n \t- Will you join the Rebels' growing force fighting for justice, or will you keep feeding the Elites' power and greed?\n\n \t- [Super Space Defenders](https://www.ssdefenders.io)"
