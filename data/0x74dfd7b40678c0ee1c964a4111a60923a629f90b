  "description": "# MetaVoicers - THE charity NFT\n3,000 hand-drawn protestors, of various rarities, amplifying their voices on the Ethereum Blockchain. MetaVoicers combine art and a passion for justice by harnessing the financial potential of NFTs and directing it to organizations working to make the world a better place.\n\nEach one of us can make a difference, but together, we can create lasting change. MetaVoicers was created to be a source of world assistance: in the NFT space, an art collection of protestors fighting for a better tomorrow; in the real world, generating funds to make lives better.\n\n#50% of minting proceeds + 100% resale royalties will be donated to charitable organizations elected by the MV community. This means that the more protestors collected—and the more circulating the MetaVerse!—the more $$ directly generated for the causes you care about!\n\n| [Website](https://www.metavoicers.io/) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gZdKTNU7Fg) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MetaVoicers) |"
