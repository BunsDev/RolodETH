  "description": "Shintaro Kago is one of Japan’s leading manga artists.\n\nKnown as the father of guro, his controversial publications of violent, erotic imagery defined a whole generation of artists.\n\nKago’s striking combination of body horror and black humour comes to life with his surrealist stop animations. Films like Monty Python and Cronenberg’s features are some of the most important influences on the artist, but manga enthusiasts might spot techniques shared by his collaborators Fujiko Fujio and Akira’s Katsuhiro Otomo.\n\nShintaro Kago work has featured on album and EP covers for Flying Lotus and Offset, as well as in countless magazines, bestselling graphic novels and art galleries both in Japan and worldwide."
