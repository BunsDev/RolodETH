  "description": "This contract contains wrapped tokens from the historic collections of DADA.\n\n[2017 ERC20 Creeps](https://bit.ly/creeps2017) | [2019 ERC721 Weirdos](https://bit.ly/2019weirdos) | [Descontrol](https://bit.ly/dscontrol) | [Animalia](https://bit.ly/dadaanml) | [Despidida Suspensa](https://bit.ly/despidida) | [Sight Unseen aka Perrodrilo](https://bit.ly/perrodrilo)\n\nThese collections include the pioneering Creeps & Weirdos, produced in 2017 and 2019, as well as iconic releases such as Descontrol, Animalia, Despidida Suspensa, and Sight Unseen aka Perrodrilo. Created at the dawn of cryptoart, these collections are groundbreaking for their introduction of on-chain royalties for artists, creation of non-fungible editions, and experimental release structures. Every drawing is a unique hand-drawn artwork created on DADA, a one of a kind platform for collaborative digital art. This wrapped token may be unwrapped at any time to receive the original and historically dated NFT."
