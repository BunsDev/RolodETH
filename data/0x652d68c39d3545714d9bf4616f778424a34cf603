  "description": "An exclusive club comprised of 5000 elderly apes who are enjoying the latter part of their life after apeing into NFTs and Crypto when they were younger. Each Old Ape is unique and programmatically generated from a variety of possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, and more. All the Old Apes are dope, but some are rarer than others."
