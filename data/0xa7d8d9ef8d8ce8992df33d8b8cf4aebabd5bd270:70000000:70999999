  "description": "Our brains are well adapted to organize visual data in the form of previously recognized patterns. This means we usually have a very hard time just accepting pure abstraction. In the structures found in “Antennas”, this phenomenon not only resides in the eye of the spectator, but it also informs the creative process behind them. In the procedure that gives shape to these layers of simple overlapping geometry, I look to let intuition find ground in the known figurative world, in shapes we recognize and give ease to our cognition, working with code in a playful back and forth in order to find a balance between complexity and meaning."
