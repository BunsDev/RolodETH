  "description": "Ryoshiâ€™s Guard is dedicated to the vision of Ryoshi: decentralization of cryptocurrency.\n\nRyoshi's Guard is designed to not only protect, but also embrace the vision Ryoshi created when he first launched Shiba Inu Token in 2020. This NFT is your ticket to Ryoshis Vision Token success and continued support of the Shiba Inu Ecosystem. This will be your access to gaming, music, and any further platforms coming from the Ryoshis Vision project. Furthermore, the proceeds from sales will be used for marketing and further developments into decentralization for Ryoshis Vision Token.\n\nRyoshis Guard collection consists of 10k unique guard NFT's consisting of 17 trait layers and over 1000 hand drawn traits items, excruciatingly implemented one by one to ensure the art looks amazing with no trait conflicts.\nOnly 10k of these will be available.\n\nGuard the Vision."
