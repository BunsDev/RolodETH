  "description": "fmfers is a collection of 6969 that serves as an art performance tributing to Sartoshi persona, mfers, all derivatives and cc0 art.  This is the final piece of the puzzle to complete the original meme “Are you winning, son?”\n\nSartoshi left on 6/9, what about his father? Does the story end there or is there any continuation? Also, Eth is going to 3 digits and our bags are illiquid AF, so let’s complete this art performance. fmfers is created by Virtalik B. a true mfer by name and by heart. \n\nfree mint here: https://fmfers.xyz/ \nreveal is 24h after sell out!"
