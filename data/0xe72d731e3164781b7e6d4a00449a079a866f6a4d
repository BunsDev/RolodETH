  "description": "No Face by Jack Frost (Episode 1) \n\nJack Frost is an Alien DJ, Metaverse Defender, and Intergalactic Hero. In this Pilot Episode, our hero introduces himself to the Universe and lays down a few basic ground rules and expectations. \n\n\"I'm from outer space. You can't see my face.\nThere's a lazer on my waist and I'm gone without a trace.\"\n\nThe song is called No Face. It is intentionally simple and repetitive and it is meant to become a war chant for the Aliens as we make our way through web3.\n\nShout out to my homie Gart on the cover art. He's a beast and we will get him into web3 soon.\n\nWeb3 is meant to be fun. Enjoy your life and celebrate music and art and technology and humanity and Aliens and family and love. And remember, everything you want is on the other side of fear. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/qv8BCDGYFT  \nhttps://twitter.com/NftFrost "
