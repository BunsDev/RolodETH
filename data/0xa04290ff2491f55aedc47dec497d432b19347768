  "description": "Tiling has been a mainstay of generative art for many decades. Truchet tiles are one of the first tiling methods that were actively studied. Truchet tiles are capable of producing interesting art and patterns, but are limited in the variations due to the fact that 4 sided tiles are used.\r\n\r\nRecent research in Truchet tilings have produced Generalized Hexagonal Truchet Tiles. Hexagonal Truchet tiles triple the number of potential tiles and hence produce much greater variation. In fact, even with small tilings, the range of variation is essentially infinite.\r\n\r\nHex Truchets uses these tiles with a large number of palettes and other rarity traits to produce unique works of art. Each print will be entirely unique in the patterns generated.\r\n\r\nHex Truchets are on chain. Each mint is produced on demand directly from the Ethereum blockchain. You will have access to your print forever, or as long as the Ethereum blockchain exists, whichever comes first!"
