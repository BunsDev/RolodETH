  "description": "The news just hit: New York was the epicenter of the pandemic. The weather was finally warming up after a long cold winter, and we were told to stay inside.\n \nTimes were uncertain, no one knew how long this would last.\nThrough my Brooklyn apartment window, I watched as New Yorkers found solace in the one place that was safe to be outside: their rooftops.\n \nRooftops turned into gyms, art studios, offices, and rehearsal spaces. I found inspiration watching the resilience of my fellow New Yorkers - in the true spirit of the city, making the most of a grim situation.\n \nI picked up my camera to document what was unfolding in front of my eyes. I didnâ€™t realize at the time that this was turning into my most important body of work, which was capturing this historical window of time. \n\nThis genesis collection of 1/1 NFT Photographs show the spirit of survival, and this is a celebration of people making the most out of a bleak situation."
