  "description": "Totem of Taste is all about the donuts. More than donuts, it is about taste buds.\nIt celebrates the delightful, sweet, and mysterious flavors that the tip of your tongue wants to remember but cannot disentangle.\nIn a bite, one sense ignites another.\nOn the palette, a color blends with its ethereal neighbor.\nA point moves in tandem with millions of other points to reflect the monumental presence of food in our lives in real-time.\nThe donuts are made with strange attractors â€“ dynamic systems that are extremely sensitive to initial conditions. The algorithm guides the trajectories of the points until they settle into deterministic shapes to naturally form textures.\n\n\n[Minimal interaction involved.
