  "description": "I worked with Iggy 2003 in Miami Beach. Being The Godfather of Punk, he did not request any grooming or styling for the shoot, very unusual for stars of his caliber. Also no publicist, just Iggy, my assistant and I. He brought a pair of jeans and a white shirt, nothing else. I brought my brand new ringflash set up and lots of b&w film, it turned out to be magic on the tanned and leathered skin of this legend. Iggy was on 100% from the moment we started and we just had fun together. We shot for 1 hour, no break, a staccato of poses and expressions, before his girlfriend came to pick him up for a Halloween Party. When the portrait of the smiling Iggy came out it had an immediate impact on my career. People were requesting the Iggy Pop light and I went on to photograph many legends in the same light. This shoot was unique in a very special way: I was able to use nearly every picture of the 207 and now they all are NFTs, including the contact sheets, living forever on the block chain."
