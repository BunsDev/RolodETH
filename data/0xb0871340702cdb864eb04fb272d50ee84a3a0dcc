  "description": "BARE USA is a nationwide fine art photography project that delves into the study* of natural beauty in contrast with man-made decay by photographing nudes in abandoned locations in all 50 US states.\n\nThis project was created to make art, to create something beautiful where there once was nothing, to produce compelling images that spark the spirit of adventure, to ignite the imagination, and evoke emotion.\n\nBARE USA shares the excitement of exploring and photographing forbidden landscapes of decay. It also challenges issues with nudity, the presence of it, photographing it, and discussing it. BARE USA shows that itâ€™s safe to embrace nudity while telling interesting stories about people and places across the USA in a unique way. \n\n*Study: A detailed investigation and analysis of a subject or situation\n\nRoadmap - Drop 100 images,  at least 1 from each state. Potential for separate limited editions  collection. Visit the discord for a full road map."
