  "description": "A long time ago, scientists found an unidentified spaceship full of incubators. After many failed attempts at trying to figure out the nature of these objects, they gave up trying. One day, almost a hundred years later, something unexpected happened: the incubators started to light up and act strange. That day happened to be the very moment humanity discovered DeFi. Was it just a coincidence? Were these events completely unrelated? We shall find out sooner than we think. We believe that whatever is inside these incubators will only be disclosed as missions are accomplished and that the first one was the discovery of DeFi. Now it's your turn to complete these final steps and unlock the mysterious creature inside. Good luck on this journey. "
