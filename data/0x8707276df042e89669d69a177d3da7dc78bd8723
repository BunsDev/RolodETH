  "description": "The DOPEWARS community is producing a game on the Ethereum and StarkWare blockchain, inspired by the classic TI-83 game we played instead of doing math homework.\n\nDOPE NFTs can now be unbundled into individual items on L2.  Some NFTs in this collection may have already been unbundled.  You can check the status of a NFT via https://dopewars.gg/swap-meet.  If the NFT states \"Ready to Unpack\" it has not been unbundled."
