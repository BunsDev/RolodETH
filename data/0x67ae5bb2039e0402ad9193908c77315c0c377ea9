  "description": "Minting is Live now!\r\nhttps://neighborheadz.op3n.world\r\nThe Neighborheadz Collection consists of 5,555 8Bit full-body characters, imagined by ‘The Mayor of K-Town’ Dumbfoundead and brought to life by artist Rikognition. This is more than just art, this is your pass into the NBHZ world, both IRL and URL. Dumb’s focus for this project is based on culture, fashion, music, and the collector’s pride to ‘rep their block on the blockchain.’ By becoming a hodler, you’re not just ‘buying an NFT,’ you’re becoming a part of the story… it’s move in day, welcome to Neighborheadz!"
