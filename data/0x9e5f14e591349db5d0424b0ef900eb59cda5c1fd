  "description": "I created the word Resemblagè (resemble+collage) to describe the type of art i’m making as the character David Nobody. This limited set of 75 1/1 proto-PFP performance NFTs represent the singular body of ephemeral and shapeshifting self portraits created as @davidhenrynobodyjr on Instagram from 2015-2020. As a virtual consciousness with \"No Body\" on Social Media, Mr Nobody defies the corporatized cookie-cutter versions of the vanity of ourselves. Resemblagè is like an inside out person and shows the grotesque, cryptic and traumatized side of humanity hidden behind the humorous masks of the everyday. He wears the excesses of consumerist society on his exterior self to expose and question society. He wears food to show how we live in waste and that we ourselves are essentially food for corporations. David Nobody’s immersion into this mental/emotional space of Resemblagè stems from the still new medium of the internet, which gazes (unprecedented) into us far more than we look into it.  "
