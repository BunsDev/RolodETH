  "description": "Birbs are randomly generated, animated, bird-like creatures that live on the Ethereum blockchain. There are 10,000 Birbs that you can own, collect, and trade. Every Birb is unique and possess certain traits which can be more rare (and desirable) than others. Technically speaking, Birbs are ERC721-compatible NFTs."
