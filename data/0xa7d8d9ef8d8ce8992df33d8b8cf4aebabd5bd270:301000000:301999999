  "description": "For as long as I can remember, I've always loved walking around the city. The crowds, the movements, the colors, the lights... As I grew up, I learned to explore the different corners, always on the lookout for new alleys to explore, the desire to discover again and again particular architectures, saturated spaces, paintings or stickers never seen before, frozen traces of passages in these anthills that are our cities.\n\nHōrō is an invitation to stop time to make room for exploration, observation and contemplation in scenes mixing the purity of architectural lines with the unpredictable movements of passers-by, where Jackson Pollock meets Anni Albers, and Hassan Massoudi meets Piet Mondrian. So many influences that mix to create an explosion of movement and send us back to physical, digital or spiritual wanderings, in which we can both get lost and find ourselves.\n\nThe Hōrō series proposes to explore representations of multiple flows through different abstract areas, while playing on a wide chromatic diversity rich with 55 palettes inspired by as many graffiti artists, urban calligraphers using color as a trace of their passages.\n\n\"Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time.\" - Thomas Merton\n\n\nOn live view, press num keys [1-9] to redraw and export an up to 9x resolution version of the scene.\n\n\nHōrō, the Art of Wandering\nLionel Radisson | makio135"
