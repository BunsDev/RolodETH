  "description": "**The first collection that is minted by sacrificing an NFT**\r\n\r\nWe have developed a smart contract that lets you mint via using an NFT. Mint and transfer are happening in a single TXN so it's pretty gas optimized.\r\n\r\nWHY?\r\n\r\n1) Most projects cant sell out during a bear market.\r\n\r\n2) People are undercutting floor prices of almost every collection when a hype project is minting during a bull market because they need liquidity.\r\n\r\nWe believe this minting method can change that since it removes liquidity needs.\r\n\r\nWe are willing to share this contract with other projects to let them mint with;\r\n\r\nOnly ETH\r\n\r\nOnly NFTs\r\n\r\nETH + NFTs\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to explain it to everyone, we wanted to show it in action and since we don't seek for securing any funds by doing that, Resurrection was the best idea.\r\n\r\nWhile introducing a new technology to the world, we wanted to give your NFTs a second chance.\r\n\r\n[Learn More](https://twitter.com/Coniunio/status/1539858419837984769?s=20&t=oAQBvSy79DlCNMo8GnRf0A)"
