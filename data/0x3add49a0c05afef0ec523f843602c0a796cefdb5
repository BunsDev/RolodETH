  "description": "Welcome to the Duckverse, Pilots!\n\nA plan was HATCHED to create machines that were large enough to track the asteroids across Ducktopia, locate them, and neutralize their Canardium remains. The MECHADUCKS went into immediate production -- destroyers, convoys, and trashmen!\n\nBut to pilot, navigate, and articulate these mighty mechanical monsters  -- the best and brightest in the pond needed to be trained as PILOTS, NAVIGATORS, and ENGINEERS.\n\n\n"
