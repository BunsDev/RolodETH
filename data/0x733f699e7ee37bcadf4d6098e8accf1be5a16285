  "description": "A limited collection of 10 000 programmatically and randomly generated NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. The collection was created to be quality art pieces. Free mint, roadmap activation depends on traded volume milestones.\n\nWhat is the story behind BOBS art? Jackk started 10 years ago painting skull faces, inspired by Mexican calavera, and gifting them to friends and family. He painted the eyes, mouths, noses and clothing as expressions of the skull's personalities: a way to communicate their individual stories, their uniqueness. Little by little, Jackk created what is now the Bag of Bones Society and the world within which it resides."
