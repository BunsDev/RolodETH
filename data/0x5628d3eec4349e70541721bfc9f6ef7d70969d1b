  "description": "This is the first-ever community-minted Non-Fungible Token (NFT). Known as \"Rebuilding the Tower of Babel\", it is constituted by 256 pieces of puzzles, which represent 256 communities from around the world. \nWe may speak different languages and come from different cultures, but people around the world can achieve amazing things through decentralized collaborations. Weâ€™re excited to watch the rebuilding of the Tower of Babel and show just how much power communities can have when they band together. \nIt's time to rebuild the Tower of Babel. "
