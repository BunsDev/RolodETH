  "description": "[Minting is Live] Chaotic Circles â€” generative abstract art collection by Yury Coding Art. \n\nIt's all about the right balance between order and chaos. Each image in the collection comprises concentric circular arcs. They're perfectly aligned with each other, creating an order that the human brain can appreciate. At the same time, arcs a heavily randomized across their parameters, making the collection diverse and interesting to explore.\n\nThere will be only 1000 Chaotic Circles. \n\nYou can still mint yours here: [mint.yurycoding.art](https://mint.yurycoding.art)"
