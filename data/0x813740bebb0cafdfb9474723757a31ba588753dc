  "description": "Stick around the Astral Realm and collect exclusive, unreleased songs written, produced, recorded, and mixed by independent artist TAROT during the February Music NFT Marathon to gain a spot in the Tarotsings Soul Tribe! Just like there are 26 miles in a marathon, there are 26 music NFTs up for grabs which can land you utilities such as royalties on her upcoming debut album release, TAROT merchandise, voting privileges on music videos/single releases, exclusive access in the Tarotsings Discord server to behind the scenes content/tarot card readings. Who needs a label when youâ€™ve got a soul tribe?"
