  "description": "It gets lonely out on the island, that is why every Chillin Chameleon should have a Sea Turtle companion to help during our ocean cleanups & adventures. The Chillin Sea Turtles will also grow to form a key part in our Chillin Chameleon ecosystem. \r\n\r\nFor a limited time we are offering up a sea turtle NFT for adoption to every single member of the CC â€“ for free (you only pay gas)."
