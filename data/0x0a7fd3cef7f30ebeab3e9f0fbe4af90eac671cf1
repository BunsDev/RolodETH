Please join Discord for updated info and Road Map        <br>\n\nDivorced.....no and they are certainly not desperate. More like abandoned by their owners and left to fend for themselves. These Ape Wives were once the most beautiful creatures in the Metaverse. Disowned by their owners, an oozing sickness began seeping into their metaverse. It is a vicious virus that has infected this community of Ape Wives. The mutating mildew has mutated the once easily recognizable and peaceful Apes into a whole new species. The Mutant Ape Wives. They found a new home in the warmth of the Blue Chimp family who took them in and provided much needed support. Now they have regrouped and are ready to head back out on their own. A force of 2,500 Ape Wives in all their gruesome complexion are coming and nothing is more fearful than a Mutant Ape Wife. "
