  "description": "FWB Fest 2022 — Idyllwild, CA\n\nSongcamp and Friends With Benefits joined forces at this year's inaugural FWB Fest in Idyllwild, California. We invited participants to join us for a one-day mini songwriting camp in which we would collectively create an Artifact Of The Fest.\n\nOn Saturday August 13th, 20+ open-minded, curious and ridiculously creative folks showed up at the Songcamp soundstage without a clue of what was in store for them. In the span of just 3 hours, we transformed from a group of strangers into a headless band of singers, producers, beat-makers and lyricists — all together creating one piece of music that represented our collective experience at fest.\n\nThe result is a beautiful medley of sonic resonance we dubbed \"Artifactual Memories\".\n\nCollectively created by Alarke (Mary), Ameet Kanon, BARTYDARTY, Brian Tamayo, Clear Mortifee, Cheizak, Daniel Ong, David Young, Hvdson, Jon Wiilde, Josh Lippi, levychain, Matthew Chaim, reider.wav, Ricky Lake, Social Work, studio_dad, wables, Zachary and more.\n\nProduced and mixed by David Young and Josh Lippi.\n\nAI and motion visuals by wables.\n\nCreative Direction by Zachary."
