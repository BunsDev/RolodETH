  "description": "“Paramecircle” explores circle packing inspired by the biology of single-celled organisms. Internal structures interact with each other in differing ways, creating a multitude of different “Paramecircles”. 64 color pallets and a monochrome mode provide that visual contrast while the other internal algorithms determine how objects are packed."
