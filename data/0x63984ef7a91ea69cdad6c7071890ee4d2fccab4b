  "description": "FEWOCiOUS is an 18 year old artist, born and raised in Las Vegas, Nevada who discovered their love of art in middle school due to being bored in class. FEWOCiOUS decided to draw caricatures of their peers to pass the time. Their art has become a way for them to process growing up and serves an alternate form of journaling. Two Feet is a platinum-certified multi-instrumentalist and recording artist from Brooklyn, New York. Streamed over 2 billion times as of 2021, triumphant on stage everywhere from Governors Ball to Austin City Limits, the #1 Alternative Radio songwriter born Bill Dess has impressively developed a massive worldwide fanbase just a few short years into his career. In addition to his musical prowess, Bill is an avid illustrator who regularly draws and paints in his spare time."
