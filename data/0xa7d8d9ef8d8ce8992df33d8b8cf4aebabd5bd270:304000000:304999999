  "description": "Anticyclones are a weather phenomena.\nThey pierce through darkness to instill peace and calm. Their planetary scale reminds us of how little we are and how powerful they can be.\n\nHigh pressure, rotation, air flowâ€¦ The \"Anticyclone\" series is an artistic exploration and interpretation of those concepts.\n\nThe rendering borrows its aesthetics from traditional and organic media like paper and crayons, to lend an analog/archival look.\n\n\"Can a computer draw like a human?\"\nThe question is asked and challenged once more through \"Anticyclone\".\n\n[Press the left/right keys to explore the different steps building the final image.
