  "description": "Alert! Each MATH token has been split into 3 universes: Red, Green, and Blue. It is your job to rescue them into RGB pixel art masterpieces. Call the \"add\" contract function with payableAmount = 0.03 and 3 MATH token ids to superimpose into a new RGB token. Owners of the MATH tokens split the fee as royalty."
