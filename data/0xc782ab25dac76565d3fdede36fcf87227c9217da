  "description": "The Rare Bears are taking over. They're cute and sweet, but tough and street. The Bears have a cool retro vibe mixed with a futuristic cyber tone. They're all about street art, graffiti, music, tech, fashion, and a few old-school video games. They're down to cuddle once in a while, but if you cross a Bear it's bad news. The Rare Bears are your ticket into the BearVerse with the most vibrant community around."
