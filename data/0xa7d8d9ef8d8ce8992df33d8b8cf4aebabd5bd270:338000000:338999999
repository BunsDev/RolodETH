  "description": "Dragons have been present in myths and legends across many different cultures, and have captured people's imagination for centuries.\n\nThere are different shapes and variations of these mythological creatures, with different names. \n\nDragons typically have four legs and wings, Wyverns have only two legs and wings, and Drakes have no wings and four legs.  undead wyverns explores the procedural generation of skeletal versions of these different kinds of creatures."
