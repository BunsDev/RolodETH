  "description": "DISCLAIMER: Most holders have withdrawn their MetaBlox NFT from OpenSea and staked it. Therefore the 'unique owners' figure the platform shows from the collection is lower than the actual proportion of unique owners. \nNFT represents a cloud miner in a premium location. It yields MBLX tokens via mining and staking. It is the receipt proof for co-mined tokens as well other community airdrop benefits. It represents the Genesis VIP status and owns special right in community management and public events."
