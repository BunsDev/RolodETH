Learn more about combo rewards here: https://discord.gg/eAZvKhByVp\n\nAs far as NFT art goes The People’s Potato is a one-click moshed potato. It’s an intentionally low-effort, low-quality NFT. And that’s what makes this a fine piece of Trash Art.  But it’s so much more than that!\n\nIn July 2020 I minted one billion of these tokens and continue to sell them at 0,0001 ETH as an experiment to challenge the ideals of rarity and scarcity in cryptoart.  They will always remain at that price until all have sold.\n\nIt went on to to be shortlisted for the most innovative NFT in 2020 and eventually received The People’s Choice Award.\n\nMore about The People's Potato: https://www.secondrealm.com/nft-art/potatoes"
