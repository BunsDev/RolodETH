  "description": "NounSNUG is SNUG's first collectible project by SNUG x Nouns. Holders will be granted commercial use rights to their own NounSNUG. SNUG aims to become a global character IP from NFT. Through this project, we aim to expand the community and awareness of SNUG. NounSNUG was started with a grant from NounsDAO through NounsDAO JAPAN.\n\nSNUG is a fairy that snuggles up to the host it finds and offers good luck instead of eating the host's anxiety and loneliness."
