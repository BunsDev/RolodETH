  "description": "As a first expansion to the World of Freight Ecosystem, we introduced Freight Punks.\n\nAs the story goes, they are entirely normal men, women, aliens, apes and zombies working in the World of Freight - looking to deliver your packages, if only the containers would be unloaded.\n\nThere are 10,000 total Freight Punk NFTs. Each punk is stored as an ERC-721 token on the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS. Every punk in the collection is unique and programmatically generated from over 161 possible traits. \nSome traits are rarer than others.\n\nThe Freight Punks come with additional utilities within the World of Freight ecosystem that will be revealed in time.\n\nVisit https://worldoffreight.xyz/freight-punks and follow @WorldOfFreight and @Supplain for more details."
