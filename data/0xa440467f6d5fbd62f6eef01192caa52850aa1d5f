Now it is their mission to introduce more females (and cute NFTs uwu) into this male-dominated crypto world and promote diversification. Weapon of choice? PPPandas.\n\nWhat does “PPPandas” stand for? A lot of you have been asking. Truthfully it stood for PowerPuffPandas. Before you cringe, we did. Which is why we are now PPPandas."
