  "description": "**11,111 BEARS, 4 CLANS, 1 PRESIDENT!**\n\nBossy Bears are 11,111 nonconformist bears living in Bearville. Each bear is from one of 4 clans (artisans, merchants, partymen & saviors). These bears recently overthrew the ruling golden bear monarch & have decided to incorporate democracy in Bearville. \n\nEach Bear has over 150 individual characteristics, but their goal is one and the same, “To help a member of their clan become the first president of Bearville”.  Your bear makes you a citizen of Bearville, giving you the ticket to participate in the ETH metaverse’s first country election & earn up to 20 ETH. \n\n[Join us](https://bossybear.club/) & experience the thrill, the highs, the lows, the friendships & the betrayals in this election season for the ultimate position of power.\n\nTo mint one, visit [our club.](https://bossybear.club/mint)"
