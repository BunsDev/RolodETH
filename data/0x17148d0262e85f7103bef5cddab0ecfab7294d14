  "description": "James Clerk Maxwell is one of the most underrepresented and yet influential human beings to have ever lived. When Einstein was asked whether he stood on the shoulders of Sir Isaac Newton he replied, “I stand on the shoulders of James Clerk Maxwell”. Einstein kept a picture of Maxwell above the fireplace in his study, alongside Newton and Faraday.\n\nThis collection is an ode to one of the greatest scientists in history and takes key components from many areas of his various works. Algorithms were used to calculate vector fields and created oscillations, curve and the electromagnetic movements you see in each Maxwell."
