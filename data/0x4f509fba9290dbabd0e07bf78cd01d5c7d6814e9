  "description": "Since April of 2021, I've written a series of songs in anticipation of The Merge. All of these songs have already been tokenized and sold as 1/1 NFTs. Now, I've collected these songs and bundled them into a single token. It's an NFT album called....\n\nThe Merge\n\nWhen is the sale?\n\nThe Merge album is an open edition, and the time-window is governed on chain by the TTD leading into The Merge. When we are ~48hrs away from TTD, the album will go on sale, and will remain available for 48hrs after The Merge.\n\nHow much?\n\nThe price changes when The Merge happens. Pre Merge price is 0.05875 eth. Post Merge price will be determined by the block number at which The Merge occurs. It'll be around double pre-Merge price.\nAll net primary and secondary sales are split like this:\n\n1/4 to the original holders of the songs\n\n1/4 to the All Core Dev team who made The Merge happen\n\n1/2 to SongaDAO\n\nUsing the Liquid Splits technology pioneered by SongCamp and implemented by 0xSplits, the $ from any sales of the 1/1s will follow the NFT to any new holder."
