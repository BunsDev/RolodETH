  "description": "SODA is the first project of the OOGA collective since leaving the cave - a new category of Metaverse assets that share a common theme in quenching your thirst for fresh GIFs. It's a randomly generated and stylistically curated NFT collection of 9669 SODAs.\n\nEach SODA is assembled from a pool of 1800 meticulously crafted parts, yielding a total of over 3.8 billion combinations, and comes from one of 7 fantastical Manufacturers under one of 32 brands.\nSODAs come in a variety of different labels, colors and flavors â€“ all designed to taste better than human-made sodas.\n\nVisit [soda.party](https://soda.party) to learn more and mint a fresh SODA!\n\n[linktr.ee/oogalife](https://linktr.ee/oogalife)"
