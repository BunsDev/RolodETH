  "description": "[Monsters (for Adventurers)](https://monstersforadventurers.com/) are randomized forgotten beasts generated and stored on-chain. Stats, images, and other functionality are intentionally omitted for others to interpret.\n\nSlay them if you can - with the right Loot! Compatible with [Loot](https://opensea.io/collection/lootproject).\n\nWe believe that the NFT ecosystem forms a set of building blocks similar to the DeFi ecosystem. We created Monsters as a base 'lego' piece that can be combined into more sophisticated social and gaming experiences. Both Monsters and Loot will become key building blocks of the future metaverse.\n\nMonsters is an emerging piece of the Loot Metaverse. Players are free to create their own stories and relationships with the Monsters and the rest of the Loot ecosystem."
