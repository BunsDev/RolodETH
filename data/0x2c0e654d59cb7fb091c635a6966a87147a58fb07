  "description": "Hi I'm Nashid Chroma, a Toronto-Based Digital Pop Artist. My work explore the threshold between the Anonymous and the Iconic. I utilize crowd sourcing methods through my social media to pick my reference image to ensure they are the most iconic, and then obscure the subjects with motifs ranging from flowers, geometric, and glitch shapes. These adornments are loaded with meaning - like the icon's place of origin - or based on the feeling I had when experiencing their performance. Finally the use of strongly saturated colour acts as an aesthetic anchor to tie my body of work into a cohesive collection. This \n body of work is the collection of limited edition NFTs of some of my most popular work!"
