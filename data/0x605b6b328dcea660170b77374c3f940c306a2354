  "description": "The Exalted NFT\n\nThe Exalted is a collection of 5,000 generative avatars drawn in a high quality pixel art style that isnâ€™t typically seen in space. Their art is based on retro fantasy Role Playing Games (RPGs.)\n\nThe project is no longer in development and all holders will be issued a full refund. These NFTs will continue to serve as a memory for the project and can/will be used in some fashion for any future development that the team decides to create.\n\nAnnouncement (6.19.2022) - https://mirror.xyz/0xindefinite.eth/64ImsKTQnKgf6t8HSE3e1IB7aROZ71hgbjXZh5l85Uw\n"
