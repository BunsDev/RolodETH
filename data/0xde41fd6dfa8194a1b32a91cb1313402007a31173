  "description": "BillionDollarDapp is a collaborative cryptographic generative art decentralized application (Dapp) on the Ethereum network.\n\nEach pixel is unique because the vector art is generated based on the cryptographic hash produced by the Ethereum network during the creation process.\n\nOnly 32 x 32 pixels will ever exist. Then, these pixels will only be available on the open market or rented.\n\nThe threads depicted on each pixel represent our shared connections to different people, milestones, or causes that we individually care about.  Pixel owners can change the color and dedication text for each pixel.  \n\nIn order to keep the artwork dynamic over time, anyone can rent pixels from the pixel owner to temporarily update the pixel color and dedication text.  Pixel owners get rental income transferred to them at time of rental.\n\nAs the larger collaborative artwork grows, the threads on each pixel interact with adjacent pixels in countless ways."
