  "description": "These NFTs are ranked in order of rarity - i.e. token #1 is also the rarest. These NFTs are a \"thank you\" to Michael Yamashita's earliest collectors who supported his MYEARTH and JIUZHAIGOU collections and will be dropped into their wallets or freely redeemed by them. \n\nYamashita GAN is a collection of 69 AI-generated NFTs using a collection of over 1,000 of National Geographic veteran, Michael Yamshita and his favorite photos from places including Jiuzhaigou, Daisetsuzan, Taklimakan Desert, Wulingyuan, and other locations he's shot over his storied 40-year career.
