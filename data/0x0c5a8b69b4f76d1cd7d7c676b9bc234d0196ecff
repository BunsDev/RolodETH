  "description": "The air around us is filled with data. Binary signals pulsating in a neverending stream. From Saratoga to Caracas. From Tokyo to Moscow. If you were to zoom in closely on these signals, you'd be surprised what you can find. Something is hiding between the ones and zeroes.\n\nWe bring you AI Pixel Buddies. A collection of 1000 dioramas that comemorates creativity in connection to technological advancements. Each piece is AI generated from scratch (no reused assets) and the collection as a whole is an attempt to in a humorous way capture the invisible world of AI that exists all around us. Sometimes, the signals are interpreted in non obvious ways, resulting in interesting artifacts.\n\npsst, the dimensions seems to be suitable for header photos."
