  "description": "Centuries ago, in the Secret coven of the ‘Sisters of Amethyst’, tensions were rising amongst the witches. The supreme witch, Nyx had been growing more and more powerful and had shown no signs of relenting. The inner circle of witches were extremely aware of this and were concerned about her unusual strength.\n\nThey decided to stage a coup, where the only solution was the death of Nyx, the supreme witch. Consequently, she was beheaded after a feast at the yearly ritual of light and the remaining leading witches formed a council to replace her."
