  "description": "POTE(n)ZA is a deflationary series of generative artworks by artist Gavin Potenza and coded by Archethect. It was the first drop on Nil DAO, selling out immediately.  ⬤  The project features a burn mechanic designed to lessen the supply.  ⬤  Burn 2 B&W to mint 1 Super Rare Color Edition.  ⬤  With each burn, the supply of POTE(n)ZAs becomes more scarce.  ⬤  Burn  →  POTENZA.ai\n"
