  "description": "Peter Bogdanovich has directed some of the most iconic movies of all time, including The Last Picture Show, which received two Academy Awards. FLUX, his final work, meant a lot to him. He felt it was important to show the process of directing, and in this NFT, you can hear as he leads Academy Award winning actress Kim Basinger through various emotions. No longer static, this new rethinking of the short film lives forever on the Ethereum blockchain, dynamically responding every moment to the movement of LIT as it changes with supply and demand. With smart contract and metadata by Transient Labs, FLUX may be the first short film that never ends."
