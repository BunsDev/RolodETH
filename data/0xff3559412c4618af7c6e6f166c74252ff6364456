  "description": "EtherCats is the first NFT project to use Chainlink VRF for mints. The historic Founders Series, limited to 500 packs (2,500 total cats), was deployed January 17th, 2021, and sold out quickly in early March once featured by OpenSea. Each cat was dynamically generated at mint with a verifiably random rating and multiplier which are now used to delegate voting power in the EtherCats DAO. Later on, the Founders Series was updated to include properties for the planned playable card game. This was also done with the support of Chainlink VRF. The highest three scores, and the highest rating of each Founders Series cat is also enshrined permanently in the EtherCats Hall of Fame. https://www.ethercats.io/hall-of-fame/"
