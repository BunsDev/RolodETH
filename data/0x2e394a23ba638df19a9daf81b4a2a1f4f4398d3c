  "description": "Biomes is a NFT generative art experiment based on Conwayâ€™s Game Of Life.\n\nBiomes mixes science and art to generate beautiful living pixels ecosystems.\n\nOnly #200 Biomes will ever be minted.\n\nBiomes have their own traits. Some are rarer than others but all of them are unique. There are even special series of Biomes with particular characteristics and effects.\n\nThis project is an opportunity to own your very own living world as well as a piece of history.\n\nBiomes batches will drop randomly, but they will always be announced on Twitter beforehand.
