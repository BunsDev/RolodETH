  "description": "Folradura means fur in Old Occitan, a Romance language spoken in the south of France. This series explores producing organic patterns using a cocktail of maths, physics, noise, and randomness. FOLRADURA is based on one main concept: local modifiers. A modifier applies a local effect to the grid of hundreds of thousands of points. What you see is the trajectory of the points. Each edition plays with one or two types of modifiers that can be positioned in many different ways, sometimes randomly and other times in a grid. Each type produces very different effects like squares, spirals, lines, and waves. Each point is influenced by all the modifiers, and all this complexity creates an organic aspect and ample details."
