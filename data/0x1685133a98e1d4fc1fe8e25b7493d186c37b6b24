As a result, a new collection will have to be created utilizing better calibration calculations. Make note that we are filing our corrected collection of KaijuKingz here (https://opensea.io/collection/kaiju-kingz) where all future experimentation will take place going forward. However, it would be a waste to destroy this current batch - perhaps there is some way we could still use these in the future..."
