  "description": "The year is 2032, and 70% of the worldâ€™s surface has been submerged. Hiding within the abyss of this planet flooded with water, is a newly evolved species of gators who disguise themselves as one of us. With no other place to go to, they are trying to raid our world and take over. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to identify, capture, and move these gators to the metaverse and save our planet.\n\n- Staking Coming Soon! \n- NFTee R&D Starting Soon!\n"
