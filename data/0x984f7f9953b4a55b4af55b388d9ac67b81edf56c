  "description": "Hi, I am Pelopoly, a low poly 3d artist who creates small worlds with a big soul.\n\nI recently posted one low poly world every day for 100 days.  I achieved my goal, and promised that If I managed it, I would create an NFT collection with these small low poly worlds.\n\nMy ambitions stretch far beyond the initial 100. But I decided I would release the first 100 daily works as an ‘Origins’ collection, that would also double up as ‘Founder’ passes, for a much larger future collection with added utility, which Origins holders will be able to have influence over and become contributors towards."
