  "description": "Infinites Real Life (IRL), is a collection of 1024 unique artworks generated at the time of the minting process. This collection builds on Infinites AI. Like the originals, each Infinite IRL was created utilizing the intersection of two generative processes: A StyleGAN trained with a curation of artworks from the Great Masters, and an On-Chain generative process that augmented a selection of the generated pieces from the first process. In addition, another On-Chain generative process was utilized to generate the final artwork, adding further depth. The artifacts are coded using custom software that is written in three.js and utilizes the Ethereum data to drive the stylistic gestures. IRLs have been explicitly designed for exhibition display.\r\nCheck also [Infinites AI](https://opensea.io/collection/infinites-ai)\r\n\r\nOr other projects by [far](https://twitter.com/0xfar):\r\n\r\n[mSeascape(s)](https://opensea.io/collection/mseascapes)\r\n\r\n[processes](https://opensea.io/collection/farprocesses)"
