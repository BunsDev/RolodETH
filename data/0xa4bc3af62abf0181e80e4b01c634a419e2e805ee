  "description": "A series featuring the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet, based on the Phosphate Solid font, hand-crafted from Canson Mi-Teintes paper.\n\nThe pieces were originally created for 36 Days of Type 2022, using multiple layers of cut paper, mixing and remixing patterns and colours.\n\nEach letter is a 1:1 representation of the individual pieces in the series.\n\nWhile each letter was assembled from real physical paper elements, the digital artifact represents the final version of the work.\n\nThere is no real world representation of the work because each letter was disassembled after being photographed, then reused and remixed into further letters in the series."
