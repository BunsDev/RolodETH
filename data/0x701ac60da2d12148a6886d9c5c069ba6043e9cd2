  "description": "_gen+esc (generation+escape) invites you to reimagine embodiments of humanity and self, depicting a world free of conventional posturing. In this series of short art films, artists wax poetic within intimate spaces unearthing identities, personalities, and histories that lie beneath our corporeal forms. While they discuss themes of belonging, process, identity and coping with global change, commonalities of escapism and contradiction arise among them all — highlighting our society’s obsession with self-image and the ironically ubiquitous bid for individuality.\n‍\nIn a digital age sculpted by super-curated experiences of false reality, creator & director Rabi uses these vignettes to pose fertile questions: are we a generation fated to chase freedom through escape? Can we accept the pervasive and persistent contradictions of the human experience?"
