  "description": "A GAN, or a Generative Adversarial Network, is a type of machine learning framework that \"learns\" in an unsupervised manner.\n\nThis collection of 1â€™111 NFTs was created by training our GAN based on HQ Human Faces & Dark Psychadelic images as well as our custom PKL file. The PKL file is specially trained on psychedelic / abstract images.  Only 448 of the original 1111 were available to mint though.\n\n\nThe PKL file used to create this collection has been destroyed to ensure that the collection can never be restored and will remain unique forever."
