  "description": "Fermented Fruit is a generative art series designed to live on the Ethereum blockchain and to be rendered in real-time by the browser. Just as food is transformed by microorganisms during the process of fermentation, the substrate of the HTML canvas is broken up into parts and transformed by cellular patterns. The project features the simulated lifeforms of cellular automata that evolve and shape-shift down an asymmetrical grid. The final artwork juxtaposes a number of textured cellular automata patterns against one another within a singular composition."
