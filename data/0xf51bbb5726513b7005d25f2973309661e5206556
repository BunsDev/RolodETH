  "description": "PUMAâ€™s first NFT project will consist of 4,000 NFTs split into two, NFRNO and FASTROID. Both designs were developed with the metaverse in mind. Designed first in 3D and tested in augmented reality before physical samples were ever created. The physical products are the first-of-their-kind experiment with new materials, technology, and design. Additionally, holders of the Nitro Collection will receive exclusive access to a first-of-its-kind metaverse experience in September."
