  "description": "⚠️Please read the description ⚠️\n\nGenerative Transfer Art Project 1 is the first in a series of experimental projects by [Wilson Cusack](https://twitter.com/WilsonCusack). Each NFT's image is created by its first 16 transfers, populating a 4x4 grid of squares. A new colored square is added on each transfer. The to address of the transfer determines the color.\n\nThere are 64 originals. Each original has up to 16 editions/copies, depending on the number of times transferred. Due to a bug, editions/copies mint more editions/copies when they are transferred. Please do due diligence to know whether you are buying an original or a copy. Copies do not add to the NFT art are when transferred, only the originals do. \n\nIf the number at the end of the url matches the displayed \"Token #...\", then it is an original. There is also a [collection of wrapped originals](https://opensea.io/collection/wgtap1-og). Visit our website and Discord for more info. "
