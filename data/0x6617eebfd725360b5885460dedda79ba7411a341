  "description": "Every New Yorker will tell you that city has changed since their day. “You missed the real New York!”\nIn the 15 years that I've lived here, I’ve seen things change dramatically, but if you walk down the street and as you pass Starbucks and Whole Foods, keep an eye out for the crazy shit that’s happening. Somewhere there are kids making music and art and creating a culture that’s gonna change the world. The only constant in New York is that it’s always changing. But it's still the Same Old City."
