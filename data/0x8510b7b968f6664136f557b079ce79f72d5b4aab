  "description": "//\nWe have been trying to contact Martians for a long time.\nNow, we have the technology to do it.\n\nOn-Chain Transponders have enabled us to write a Message to Martians and receive Space Capsules, beamed down from Space.\n\nMint a Transponder and get a \"Space Capsule\" beamed down a gift from the Martians. It contains your Space Gear essential for your adventure into space exploration and colonization\n\nYou can use your Transponder to write a word in the Message to the Martians whenever you desire.\n‍\nMessage Writers will also get an NFT of their written Word as a token of appreciation.\n‍\nTo keep our message in manageable length for the Martians, we will limit the message to 8,888 Transponders and Space Capsules only.\n\nAll Transponders, Space Capsules,  Words, and the Broadcasted Message are generated entirely on-chain.\n//"
