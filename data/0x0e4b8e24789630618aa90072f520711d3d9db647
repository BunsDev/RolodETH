  "description": "The original Blitmap collection had 10,000 possible combinations, but only 1,700 were allowed to be minted. We rediscovered the missing 8,300 and made them available as a Flipmaps.\n\nFlipmap is a derivative project created under the terms of CC0. We are not affiliated with the official Blitmap collection (but we do love them!)."
