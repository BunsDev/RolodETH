Any one of these stencils might have taken Snuffy a week to design.. A week of taking someone's deeply personal story, relating it to his own life, and transcribing those emotions into visuals that are deep and digestible. It’s no small task, in fact its fucking hard to do.\n\nSo much goes into one. This is 555 of them… (SNUFFY 500 sounds better). He saved the stencil of his first tattoo, and continued with every tattoo thereafter. Not knowing what for but knowing it would be worth it one day. This project has been in the works for his entire career, because it is his entire career. Buying a Snuffy 500 is buying a slot on the timeline of his life’s work.\n\n- anonymous\n\n\n\n"
