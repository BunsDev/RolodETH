  "description": "Each Phettaverse case can be many things embodied into one, but each case is the core of the Phettaverse storyline from the outside—a way for Phetta to document and keep track of every new being and event that takes place. \n\nSome may ask, what can you take away from these cases? In simple terms, they are moments in life—experiences, lessons, dreams, goals, and expression. What is life without these, and what is life without a way to share these with others?\n"
