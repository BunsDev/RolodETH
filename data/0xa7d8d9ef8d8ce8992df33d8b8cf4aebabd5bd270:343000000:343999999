  "description": "Balletic is a generative art animation created by digital artist Owen McAteer, aka. Motus Art.\nIn this piece, a grid of rotating blocks move together in a mathematically choreographed dance to reveal hidden patterns, shapes and flowing figures.\n\nExploring soft fluid motion in a hard fixed grid of blocks to a two-tone minimalist design, the piece comes to life in dance, conducted by the combination of several algorithms, easing curves and timing modifiers all working together."
