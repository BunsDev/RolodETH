  "description": "Psycho Bunny has joined forces with the acclaimed New York City street artist Buff Monster to create a six-piece art collection. His illustrious style and vivid color usage has been distilled into lively interpretations of the Psycho Bunny logo.\n\nThe Buff Bunny 100 draws on his signature pink and neon green hues to seamlessly incorporate 80â€™s graffiti and skateboarding culture into this striking rendering of the Psycho Bunny logo."
