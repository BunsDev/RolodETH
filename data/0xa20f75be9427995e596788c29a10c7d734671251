  "description": "deadmau5 is a Canadian electronic music producer, DJ, and musician. deadmau5 mainly produces progressive house music, though he also produces and DJs other genres of electronic music, including techno under the alias Testpilot. deadmau5 has received six Grammy Award nominations for his work. Michah Dowbak aka Mad Dog Jones is a multidisciplinary artist from Thunder Bay, Ontario. His works deftly interweave cyberpunk elements with the beauty and freedom of nature. As a lover of the wilderness, which was ever present where he grew up, he brings a fresh thematic to the metropolitan aesthetic, done up in citrus and neon tones of technology somehow rendered as a space naturally human. Over the last two years he has created artworks for Run The Jewels, Deadmau5, Jabbawockeez, Conor McGregor, Maroon 5 and Chromeo. His first and only IRL exhibit was AFTERL-IFE WORLD in Tokyo Sept-Nov 2019."
