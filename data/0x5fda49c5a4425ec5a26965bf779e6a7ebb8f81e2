  "description": "The Fancy Parrots is a collection containing **1000** unique randomly generated parrots flying between blocks of the Ethereum network. After the mint, you will receive an egg containing your unique bird. The hatching of the egg will occur after the sold out of all NFTs. When the royalty threshold is reached, we will release a collection of baby birds for holders, make unique animations of traits, as well as something else, but for now it's a secret."
