  "description": "THE SOURCE CoDE is a new techno-mystical framework that channels knowledge from source creation to our digital present. The medium of this knowledge is a set of unique 1024 “karma” cards minted in the Genesis phase of THE SOURCE CoDE. The Hash is a unique entity that drives all aspects of a single card.\n\nTHE SOURCE CoDE framework is based on 10 primitives, with each primitive representing a dimension of reality. Some cards have additional attributes that further empower the card holder. When you mint a card, an Intent is generated - the most powerful tool for navigating the endless possibilities in life.\n\nMint with purpose!"
