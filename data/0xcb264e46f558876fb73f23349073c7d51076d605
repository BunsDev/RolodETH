  "description": "The “Relic Punks” are the first official Relic Reserves collection brought to you by Metarelics and created by Jeff Cole. \n\nThe Punks are a 36 piece tribute to important cultural technology of the past. The collection uses nostalgia to bring back the emotional relationship and connections we had growing up with consumer devices. \n\nRelics Pass holders were able to redeem their choice of punk for each pass they hold. Minting took place from 04/15/22 to 04/20/22."
