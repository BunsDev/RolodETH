  "description": "“Placement” is a generative system that creates hard-edge color field compositions by placing rectangles on a grid. Each compositional element is uniform in scale and can be derived from this relationship: the short side of the outer rectangle is equal in length to the long side of the inner rectangle. The blockchain determines the number of and arrangement of compositional elements. This inherent lack of control leads to surprising complexity or stark simplicity. This series explores how color influences our perception of space and how adjacent colors influence perceived color hues. Such work is inspired by the works on paper by Donald Judd. To this effect, 10% of the proceeds from primary sales will be donated to the Chinati Foundation. Furthermore, due to the recent oil spill in southern California, an additional 10% of the proceeds from primary sales will be donated to the Surf Rider Foundation in order to keep marine life safe and our beaches clean."
