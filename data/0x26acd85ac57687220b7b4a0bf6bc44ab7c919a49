  "description": "CryptoGamblers are a limited collection of 777 completely randomly generated NFTs. Each CryptoGambler is algorithmically generated to feature a unique combination of 77 potential variables across 7 different traits such as face, skin color, clothing and various attributes. Each NFT can be owned by a single person on the Ethereum blockchain and is uploaded on IPFS.  The last CryptoGambler #777 will be given to a random CryptoGambler owner.\n\nAfter each minted batch of 70 Crypto Gamblers, there will be a lottery and the lucky gambler will receive ðŸ’°17.77% of the total sales of the said batch "
