  "description": "The Pythagorean school of thought taught us that numbers are the basis of the entire universe.  The rest is but a mere expression of those.  Numbers are all around us , have always been , will always be.  \r\n\r\nIf our base reality itself is an expression of an underlying algorithm, wouldn’t the n be just another loop of algorithmic reality creation; layer on top of layer, infinite?\r\nAnd so, as the Big Bang is a symbolic manifestation of the creation of our reality, the @the_n_project_ is just another Big Bang of an alternate reality — the metaverse.\r\n\r\nPythagorean Masks are the first of the creations of the @_n_Collective.  The Collective settled on Masks as a design choice in order to amplify the idea that the individual who wears them shall hide his identity for that the Collective can shine.  The Collective are the Mask holders, the Mask wearers; it represents your belonging to a community, the Collective, with the potential to shape reality in unprecedented ways."
