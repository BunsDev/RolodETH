  "description": "The Inu Kings Club is a collection of 5,000 unique imperial Inu King NFTs that live on the ETH blockchain (ERC-721). With more than 220 traits, each Inu King is algorithmically created with its own unique name and characteristics. Once all Inu Kings are minted, all NFT holders will be eligible to claim an Inu Mutant NFT free of charge, you'll just pay the gas. The holder of any Inu Mutant Kings NFT will be eligible to stake their Inu Mutant King NFT and receive rewards in the form of a fungible token ($KINGS coin).\n\nWe will also be creating a community wallet which will be used to maximize the growth of our community while also rewarding our early adopters. We will use these community funds for future integrations as well as giveaways and more."
