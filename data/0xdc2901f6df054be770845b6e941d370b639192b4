  "description": "Roe Ethridge and [Zome.art](https://zome.art) present *22 Pigeons*, a collection of twenty-two new works derived from Ethridge’s iconic series of flying pigeons. To create these original works, Ethridge scanned and combined his analogue pigeon photographs from the early 2000s, resulting in a collection of visually dynamic digital collages.\n\nRoe Ethridge is a leading figure in contemporary photography today, with a broad exhibition history that includes elite institutions such as The Museum of Modern Art and The Whitney Museum of American Art. His work has been published extensively, both in numerous monographs and in high end magazines. Ethridge’s style and practice has influenced a generation of photographers, and he continues to push the boundaries of the medium with his exhibitions, books, magazine work, and now NFTs.\n"
