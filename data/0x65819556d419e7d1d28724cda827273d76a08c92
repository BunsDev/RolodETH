  "description": "Digital art generated by AI is blooming, but artist Demos Chiang wants to do the opposite. The 《Gentle Panther》NFTs consist of 515 unique leopard heads. Instead of creating randomly through algorithm, each piece is created manually. Emphasizing the uniqueness of art in the old fashion way. Adopting “Wise men mend their ways” as the base, and integrating the five elements (metal, wood, water, fire, and earth) as the surfaces, the artist attempt to celebrate the balance of natural energy through the 515 panther heads. This is a reflection of humanistic essence and craftsman spirit.\n\nEach piece represents a metamorphosis. Unique in its own way for collectors to hold and share. Furthermore, the artist also view the launching of the NFT more as an artistic behavior. At different stages, the collectors will have the opportunity to participate in different physical art incubation. 1% of the collectors will have the opportunity to collect the corresponding physical art works, and with further participation, will be entitled to purchase a NFT limited sculptures."
