  "description": "Good Society Volume 3 is a journey from one end of the record to the other. One year ago they set out to create the ultimate Hip-Hop & Electronic album with artists who've really invented their own corner of the scene. Weâ€™re now releasing this diverse collection of songs via web3 in order to represent for all the melodic production, unique arrangements, and lyrical flows that are possible when artists create without boundaries."
