  "description": "V&V is a DeFI game on the Ethereum Blockchain where Vikings and Villagers compete in the bountiful lands of the Nordic, the VikingVerse. Villagers produce $GOLD while seeking protection from Vikings, who earn $GOLD by taxing the Villagers. But beware, Vikings often seek more than they deserve and may attempt to raid Villagers! Countless battles will be fought over the control of $GOLD. Will you try to keep the peace? Or wage war? Power, Betrayal, and most importantly, Glory. Do you have what it takes? For Glory!"
