  "description": "Disobedience to the rule, precarious balance of eccentric forms, crystallization of a fertile tension between virtual and material reality. \n\nHere: none of that, whatever it means. \n_D-D-Dots_ is essentially an excuse to play, and thatâ€™s what we did. \nWe had fun staking, assembling, colouring, and then again destroying and rebuilding, just like we used to do in childhood. \nAs we worked, the idea of the circuit became stronger and stronger, but only in its broadest sense. It could refer as much to branched-chain amino acids as to the complex network of an entire city, whose elements connect and exchange flows of any kind. \n\nWe like to keep reading them differently from time to time. However, once a work is finished, its author disappear, or at least no longer matters. \nWhat do **you** see there, rather?"
