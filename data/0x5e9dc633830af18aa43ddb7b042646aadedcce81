  "description": "#**11,111 SPRAY PAINTED AVATARS BY LEGENDARY STREET ARTIST, [AME72](https://ame72.com) **\n\nDOJI are explorers. They are pilots, researchers, and engineers. They are space-bound pariahs, searching the skies for a new world to call home. It may take years, generations, or eons, but they will keep searching as long as the stars burn, until their momentum shifts again.\n\nXCREW Are an evil faction of space terrors barreling towards Earth, the last habitable planet in the galaxy. Upon arrival, they will destroy all signs of life to start anew from the ashes.\n\nWHICH SIDE WILL YOU CHOOSE?\n\n- > All art organically created by famed street artist [James Ame (Ame72)](https://ame72.com).\n- > [COURIER Technology](https://courier.dojicrew.com) allows collectors to send and receive NFT gifts directly from their DOJIs.\n- > Each DOJI passively [earns a salary of ERC20](https://dojicrew.com/pay) tokens to spend on upgrades, exclusive art, and more.\n\n\nPowered by (QuantumTECH)[https://quantum.tech]\n"
