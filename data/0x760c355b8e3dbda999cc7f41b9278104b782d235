  "description": "Look, we’re all going to die, right? At least you’ve got a cute Grimmie as a souvenir, and to leave behind for someone you love.\n\nThis is a women-led, women-designed project. Artwork by Grace Lee.\n\nGrimmies are a project powered by Webacy. We are the platform that protects your crypto for the unexpected. Our products include a backup wallet, a panic button for hacks, and of course, a crypto will. Owning a Grimmie is an immense responsibility and privilege. All owners of Grimmies will have early access to the Webacy product and pricing privileges for life. They will also have access to our exclusive Discord channel and all future perks and utilities."
