  "description": "A collection of 6969 wicked witty well-crafted corpses from the underworld, now being resurrected over the graveyard from an unorthodox experiment. We are not your common NFT, we do things differently. We stand out from the horde. Dead or alive, we vibe! No Promises. But keep an eye out for some deadly clues and you'll never know."
