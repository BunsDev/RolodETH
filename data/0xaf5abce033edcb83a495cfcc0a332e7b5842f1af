  "description": "\"First came the need for food, second came shelter\"\n\nWrapped Hotels is a collection of unique hotel rooms divided\ninto 3 categories, each with a specific function: rooms, lounges and\nreception desks.\n\nA Wrapped Hotels NFT acts as a deed of ownership for its equivalent\nroom in The Sandbox metaverse. Thus, the owner of a Wrapped Hotels\nNFT also has ownership rights to the Sandbox equivalent.\n"
