  "description": "Somewhere in a galaxy far away, a multidimensional being is looking at this clock and thinking about the impermanence of existence and the infinity of the universe. This art is endless and deterministic. Use full screen for full immersion. Click/tap or use keys 1 to 9 to switch speed. s = toggle starts. t = toggle hyperspace. Space = pause. It is part of the TBOA project. Check your collection at https://www.theblocksofart.com"
