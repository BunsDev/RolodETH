  "description": "In 1964, a Zambian science teacher named Edward Makuka Nkoloso decided to train the first African crew to ever travel to the moon. His plan was to use an aluminium rocket to put a woman, two cats and a missionary into space. He founded the Z.N.A.S.S.R.A.R, that is, the Zambian National Academy of Science, Space Research and Astronomical Research and built his headquarters 20 miles from the capital, Lusaka. In 2012, I used this anecdote in African History to build a series that reflects on the poor expectations we have on the African continent and how limited is the Western understanding of it despite how profusely itÂ´ s been documented and photographed. After 10 years as a photojournalists I thought some questions should be raised around the role that photography plays in constructing the official versions that feed History and stereotypes, and how exposed we are to propaganda when we do not question the images that are placed in front of us."
