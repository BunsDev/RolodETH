  "description": "Minters are the metaverse avatars, which combine different worlds, movie franchises & pop culture universes. During the process of their development, we were inspired by many of our favorite, classic movie franchises, comics, and gaming universes. It's clear to us that when the metaverse happens, people will want the unique avatars, with traits & themes that they are already familiar with. \n\nMinters World avatars now combine 2911 Minters & 3500 DroEats. Each year, 1000 more Minters will be released, with different utilities, styles, and innovations in avatars technology, while still being based on the original ones.\n\nWe are building Minters Arena, on-chain adventure arena, with fighting gladiators that player can control, and compete with others.\n\nFull commercial rights: https://mintersworld.com/license"
