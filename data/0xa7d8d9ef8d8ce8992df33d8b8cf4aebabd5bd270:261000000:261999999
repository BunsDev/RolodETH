  "description": "Para Bellum(*) is about the conflict of emotion and gut instinct versus logic and reason. \nEmotions are portrayed by color fields; logic is illustrated by words.\nThese two forces are fighting for dominance over the canvas.\n\nUnder the hood, ​​Para Bellum utilizes a thin language engine that was trained by reading dozens of books about rebellion and anarchy to generate (mostly) non-existent English phrases. An on-chain embedded font is used to render the familiar, readable letter shapes against the abstract fuzzy color fields.\n\n(*) Para Bellum is half of the Latin phrase “Si vis pacem, para bellum”. If you want peace, prepare for war."
