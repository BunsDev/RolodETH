  "description": "1999 wolves were born on the planet naviya, a place forgotten by the UN government, where resources are barren and plagued by disasters. The tribes are always fighting for the limited resources. Like all intelligent beings, Wolf L, who was born on the planet naviya, had a dream to move to Pandora, where the government of the Cosmic Union is located. It is rich in resources and pleasant environment, but it belongs only to the Vistani, one of the one billion higher races. They are the hereditary nobles who rule the whole universe."
