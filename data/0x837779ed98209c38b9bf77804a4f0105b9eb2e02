  "description": "**PunkBodies** are artist-designed and machine-generated pixel art images of bodies built on the Ethereum blockchain that complement existing CryptoPunks. There are 10,000 bodies, and each compliments the type and skin color of every single Punk in existence. With **PunkBodies**, you can combine and compose new combinations of Punks and Bodies, creating a full mintable avatar we refer to as **Punksters**. Match, mix, and mint any combo of Bodies and Punks on [Showcase](https://www.punkbodies.com/showcase) page.\n\nInterested in buying a Punkster (Punk + Body combo)? Go to [Punkster](https://opensea.io/collection/punksters) collection.\n\nFree airdrop for Punk owners is available to claim until April 11th. You can also build a closet and mint Bodies as many bodies as you want at [PunkBodies.com](www.punkbodies.com/mint)\n"
