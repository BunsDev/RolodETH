  "description": "Inspired by Vivaldi's work.\n\nAn emotional, raw aesthetic and provocative collection and vision of the artist with her paintings taken with a film camera. Four paintings make reference to the seasons\n\nHer works are key, as is the use of own body to convey her ideas. Engagement in the experience. A sacred ritual and merging with one's creativity. Posing in silence or with loud music near the paintings. It making you perceive everything as one creative flow.\n\nArtist: Alex Barss\n\nRaw. Flash. Vivaldi"
