  "description": "SUPERCLUSTER is a 1/1 Grail that is minted on the Transient Labs Shatter Contract, and is comprised of 1110 Drips from the Drip Drop Collection. It is an ultra hi-resolution collage of the project, and represents the most prized asset. An even higher resolution work will be presented via physical delivery of an encrypted thumb drive shipped to the original collector. The collector has the option to “shatter” this 1/1 into 111 editions of the same work, and sell those editions. If any collector reunites all 111 editions, they can fuse the works back into a 1/1 masterpiece."
