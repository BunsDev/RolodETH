  "description": "THE NEXU5 is first and foremost its own comic series, which mainly revolves around the characters Lorian, Jade and Snakebyte, who are gifted gamers in the virtual universe THE NEXU5. However, besides the comic series, there is also a collection of 8,888 unique avatars.\r\n\r\nThese avatars are not NFTs that just sit in your wallet, but can compete against other avatar owners in 1v1 battles in a connected game. There are 5 different factions, 3 different rarity levels and 4 different classes like Assassin or Cyberpriest. (TBA)\r\n\r\nHolders also own the commercial rights to the avatars - with one minor exception, which are the \"OUTSIDERS\", as these appear in the actual comic and are therefore the exclusive property of ENCODE Graphics."
