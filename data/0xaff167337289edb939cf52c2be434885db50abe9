  "description": "SOLIDS is a Generative Architecture NFT Project. *MINTING NOW =>> [solids.live](http://www.solids.live)*\r\n\r\nThere are 8,888 + 512 unique buildings generated algorithmically, enabling utility in the Metaverse. \r\n\r\n*As the Metaverse is becoming more ubiquitous, we are seeing many different examples of virtual worlds emerging. Immersive virtual worlds are not something novel; however, blockchain technology and cryptocurrency are bringing another level of excitement. The combination of technologies adds a more tangible layer to our virtual experience, which extends the material world. *\r\n\r\n*In this context of expansion into the Metasphere, Architecture is needed to shape the habitat of the Virtual Realm. This is where SOLIDS was born, as an essential response to the needs for buildings in the established and upcoming Digital Environments.*\r\n\r\nSOLIDS were created by FAR.
