  "description": "These animated fish tank NFTs feature ‘live’ walker heads floating about, gnashing and looking around. These animations loop in ‘gallery mode’ meant to be enjoyed all day, just like The Governor did with a glass of whiskey. Purchase, collect, share and trade. Just don’t forget to feed them!"
