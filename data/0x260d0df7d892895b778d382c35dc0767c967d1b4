  "description": "1,000 Punks escaped the blockchain long enough to sit for a studio session with portrait photographer David Lawrence. After they returned to the blockchain their Portraits were minted to commemorate the occasion. **This collection is the official collection** after migrating off of the OpenSea shared contract. Check the [all-time Photography Stats on opensea](https://opensea.io/rankings?sortBy=total_volume&category=photography-category) and you'll find that the collection is in the top-30, having done nearly 100ETH in sales before the migration. \n\n[Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/Fb6C2dUKH9)"
