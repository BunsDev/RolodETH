  "description": "OLD, DO NOT BUY\n\nKongs vs Kaijus, who will prevail?\nKong Game is an innovative P2E game that unites a unique combination of ERC 721 and ERC 20 mechanics that allows you to stake your NFTs for tokens in exchange for more NFTs. \n\nKong Game introduces fun mechanics that allow the player to mint more NFTs from their staking rewards but also involves high stake mechanisms that allow some players to steal other playerâ€™s tokens and NFTs. PLAYER BEWARE!\n\n1 $FOOD = 1 $FOOD. The sole purpose of $FOOD is to be used as a utility token to participate within the Kong Game ecosystem. $FOOD has no other functionality and it cannot be purchased from The Kong Game Developers.\n\n"
