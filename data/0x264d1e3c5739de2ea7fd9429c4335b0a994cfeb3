  "description": "The Genesis Collection:  \n\nForever there’s been a battle at the Crypto Grove between the bears and the bulls, the hedge funds against the little guys & the suits versus retail. A fight that can now become less lopsided and fair game thanks to our\nincoming financial market superheroes. Defi Rangers are Crypto based helmeted humanoids here to save, protect & bring home the lambos to retail trading.\n\nThe fight won’t be easy so we’ve called upon 1902 Defi Rangers that were randomly generated, which are very unique & are way out there when it comes to the art that's been designed by traders themselves. Trading can get\nintense at Crypto Grove.  Join us on this journey and wild ride to serve, protect and fight the bears, suits and evil hedge funds of Crypto Grove together.\n\nYour Defi Ranger grants you 100% full creative and commercial rights."
