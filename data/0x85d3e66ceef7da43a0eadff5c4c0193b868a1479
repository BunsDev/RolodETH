  "description": "I have functioned from a place of a thousand \"You Can\r\nNots\" (YCN) and with each discouragement, I mustered strength and\r\ncourage.\r\n\"You cannot do photography with a phone,\" they said.\r\n\"No one is going to hire you,\" they said.\r\n\"You are wasting your time, get a life\", they said.\r\n\"Your phone pictures will never make it to any Art gallery\", they said.\r\n\r\nWith each YCN I gained a lot of experience and skill.\r\nWith each YCN, the commitment, confidence, and consistency grew,\r\nI present to you:\r\n\r\nZeptoseconds of my Journey as a Smart Phone Photographer."
