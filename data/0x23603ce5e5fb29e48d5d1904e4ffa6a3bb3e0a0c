  "description": "Chapter I - The Verdict\n\nWe have received numerous reports of Free Guys acting up, 7,000 to be exact. Some are in for carjacking, others for arson, and a few have even been accused of murder. As a holder, it is your mission to convince us of your Free Guy's innocence. Several weeks after mint, a snapshot will be taken and holders will be messaged a detailed description of their Free Guy's crime. Your task will be to respond to this message with a brief paragraph explaining why your Free Guy is innocent. You'll have to get creative for this. Depending on how convincing you are, you will either be able to claim a Guilty Free Guy or a far rarer Innocent Free Guy. We'll see you in court."
