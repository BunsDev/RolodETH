  "description": "The Divine is a collection of 4,477 hand-drawn, cosmic, angelic warriors that protect and nurture all that is good in the observable universe of their realm.\n\nThey are guided and created by the omnivalent Arc and reside in The Heavens. From The Fire, the dark world below The Heavens, demonic spawns arose to fight and overtake The Arc. Ultimately, The Fire failed, but this left a tainted mark on The Arc and The Heavens; that wouldn't be the last fight.\n\nEach Divine NFT holder will be a part of this fight as we prepare for the next Eradication.\n\nVisit https://divinenft.io website for more details or our Discord."
