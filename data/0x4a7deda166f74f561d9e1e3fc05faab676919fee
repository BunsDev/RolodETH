  "description": "Sumo is a Luxembourg based artist, known for his colourful paintings and larger-than-life installations in collaborations with international brands such as Porsche and LUXAIR. Bursting with statements, slogans, motifs and intense colours, his compositions represent an abstract documentation of moments. An overall concept of time and space fills the picture plane in a sprawling, virus-like mode. Step back to view the big picture or come in close for a microscopic view. His mischievous moniker - Crazy Baldhead - that started life as a graffiti tag in 1999, has evolved into a signature character of its own. 2022 marks the year that Sumo launches his career into yet another “Canvas”: digital art and of course NFTs. A long-term plan in which the artist is aiming to expand the scope of his universe, as well as his vision of eventually bringing it to life through animation and VR technology."
