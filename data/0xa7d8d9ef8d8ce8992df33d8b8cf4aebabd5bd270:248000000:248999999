  "description": "~~~~~~~~~~~  Simple, Pure & Uncut Noise, straight from the Hash ~~~~~~~~~~~ \n\nHashCrash is an ode to the book SnowCrash, written by Neal Stephenson. This book had a very big influence on the crypto and NFT culture. Long before NFT's or concepts like the MetaVerse were used, Stephenson already described the things we are living with today. For example, he introduced the concept of HyperCards, digital items that could be exchanged and sold in the MetaVerse.\n\nOne of the main concepts in the book is what is called \"SnowCrash\". This is a digital drug that can take over the minds of people, turning people into puppets to be controlled by their master. The drug was represented as a type of visual noise that could bring the viewer into a trance state. Like SnowCrash, NFT's have quite some effect on our minds and body, the addictive behavior and price rushes of NFTâ€™s evoke in people clearly something that has resemblance to how certain drugs work. \nHashCrash plays in a cynical way with this concept of a digital drug. \n\nBy simply representing the pure input hash-data and mapping it  to color, geometric figures appear. By mirroring and cycling through the numbers, the structures behind the random hash string come alive. What seems as a simple noise pattern, can reveal whole worlds to explore for the ones that look closely. The fast paced representation of the hash data can evoke different feelings from relaxation to panic. \n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Cheap, fast & powerful  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ \n\n* No customized rarities for this one. What you see is purely translated randomness from the transaction hash.\n\n** Stare at the center closely in live mode for guaranteed breakthrough within 10. minutes\n\n*** Use with care, do not watch when sensitive for strobing lights.\n\n"
