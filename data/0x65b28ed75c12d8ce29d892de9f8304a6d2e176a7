  "description": "Chubby Kaiju's have had a rough go lately. Things will change. Stay tuned!\n\nChubby Kaiju's are cute and unique! They are more than just Chubby, cute monsters. There is more than meets the eye. \n\nPurchasing a ChubbyKaiju NFT allows you to join ChubbyKaijuDAO; a vibrant community of web3 enthusiasts who exercise their democratic governance and voting rights to drive the Project Vision through their Chubby Kaiju Tokens. Through an Indirect Democratic system, the Chubby Kaiju's vote on the allocations and usages of the Chubby Treasury.  The first proposal passed was to purchase 100E worth of $SOS and stake it.  This has given the Chubby Kaijus a large voice in the OpenDAO protocol.\n\n ChubbyKaiju holders will receive access to exclusive incentives, experiences, and more. Follow @ChubbyKaijuDAO on Twitter for updates!"
