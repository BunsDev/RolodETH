  "description": "Puppy Play is a sprawling community where participants take on the simple headspace of a K9 to escape the unrelenting gears of everyday turmoil. Sometimes, packs are formed, a chosen family with self appointed hierarchy. Roles are split between the Alpha, Beta, and Omega.\n\n\nThis project began in 2016 as a vehicle for self exploration, evolving into an ongoing artistic journey that would become my most distinct body of work.\n\n​\n\nThis work exalts the Pups and Handlers community, a group who's dedication to authenticity I admired deeply.\n\n​\n\nBeyond the surface, this work is also an exploration of trans-humanism. Shedding the limits of our humanity in order to become a creature free of limitation."
