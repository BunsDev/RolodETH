  "description": "The PNW Collection, are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTâ€™s) of salmon, inspired by indigenous art from this region. Many of the indigenous tribes in the PNW built their communities around the salmon which provided for them since their arrival here. These native peoples created beautiful art images which incorporate salmon in their oceanic and riverine environments.\r\n\r\nThis art is created to honor the indigenous art of the region and to bring awareness, support and funding towards the charitable work of nonprofits in the PNW in protecting and conserving salmon. The funds will be used for the establishment and rehabilitation of natural spawning and rearing habitat for anadromous fish. We choose the spawning phase of a pacific salmon because the upriver salmon migration is one of nature's most exciting dramas.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.thesachikogroup.io/salmon"
