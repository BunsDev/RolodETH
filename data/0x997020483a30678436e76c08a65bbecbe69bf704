  "description": "What is the relationship between [Pets], [Role] and [Loot]?\n 1. Pets will evolve with [Role] and [Loot], the key intermediary in uniting the two into a [Role+] NFT. \n2. The evolution of [Role+] happens only when the owners combine [Pets], [Role] and a certified [Loot] project (incl. [Loot], [mLoot], etc. in terms of future partnerships decided by the community. Remember that each [Pets] or certified [Loot] project can pay homage (i.e. be used in the evolution) towards [Role] ONCE ONLY. More detailed plans about [Role+] will be released soon."
