  "description": "OFF---BLUE is pioneering the connection between non-fungible tokens and tangible products. This relationship is established by a QR code that is embedded onto each physical product. The specifically generated QR code links the physical product permanently to the NFT and authenticates that the buyer has physical and digital ownership of the product. The goal is to create a trustworthy and on-trend exchange platform for buyers and sellers of limited edition physical and digital artworks."
