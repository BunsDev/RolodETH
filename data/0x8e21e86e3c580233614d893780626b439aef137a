  "description": "After the crypto crashed on 6/11/22, the days to follow were dark in our community. I thought about why I left web2 and reminded myself why I am in web3 and how much art has helped me and others. So I decided to host a 24 hours Twitter space where I would sketch a new piece every hour for 24 hours straight. I knew it sounded crazy, but crazy is what we needed, an abrupt shift in flow and communal consciousness of artists and friends. Fast forward 24 hours later, and I created 24 pieces to mark the June 2022 crypto crash. It was a wild experience where artists, friends, and collectors vibed and independently created together. It's a time I will never forget and may do again in the future. \n\n(remaining mints burned on 6/20 12pm PST)\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x9bd9e0b2e3f5ce7273f4a832f0df711a249e176ea2a0050a482650b3cf856bfe\n\nTwitter thread: https://twitter.com/manicdistopia/status/1536407930219528194"
