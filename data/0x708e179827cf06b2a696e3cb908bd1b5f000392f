  "description": "The series “Mutation #2” includes 35 single edition videos depicting a painted living portrait gradually being erased, layer after layer. As the human face disappears, the looming backdrop of a dark city takes its place, calm and mysterious, with its habits and routines. \nThis work is based on the filming of a painted model. It is made of layers of acrylic body painting and several additional post-production layers."
