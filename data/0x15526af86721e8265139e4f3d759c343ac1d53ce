  "description": "Meet the Pistols Birds!\n\nReserva, one of the hottest brands in Brazil, launches its first NFT Collection, The Pistol Birds.\n\nMade to serve its community, grant special benefits to the holders, and co-create Reserva's path into the metaverse. The collection is divided into 3 categories: Admission, Creator, and Royal Series.\n\nWe've teamed up with our long-time partner NGO Banco de Alimentos. Each NFT gives an % amount to support their operations. \nReserva donates +1 ETH at each 25% of the supply sold at mint sales.\n\nAll carbon emissions have already been neutralized in the partnership with Moss Earth.\n\nCheck benefits and verify token availability at usereserva.com/x and discord.gg/reservax"
