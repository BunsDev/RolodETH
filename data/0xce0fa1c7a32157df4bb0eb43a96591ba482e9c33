  "description": "Sleeping Suburbia consists of photographs taken in suburban/rural scenes in the dead of the night. The silence of a closed business, the glow of a bright interior, the webbing of directional shadowsâ€¦these scenes capture & depict the bones of otherwise lively communities. I process my images with low contrast techniques, and when composing, often incorporate negative space into the frame. Through this, I create a sense of displacement, pushing viewers to question comforts they have in their hometown."
