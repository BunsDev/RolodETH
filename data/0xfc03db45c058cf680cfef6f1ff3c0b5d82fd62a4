  "description": "Harems is a collection of 10,000 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs); each NFT is a unique digital collectible of Harem Girls covering 235 countries around the world that exist on the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nMost of these will be animated - some of these will be live girls.  We will dedicate 2% of all Harems resales to go to the community to be used in whatever form the community wishes. Owners of 1 Harems NFT will have access to the VIP chat letting you talk with Harems live girls.\nOwners of 5 Harems NFTs will be spawned one of 11 benefactors i.e. Sultan, Movie Star, Mormon etc. Each benefactor earns an income in Harems tokens; the income of the benefactor is dependent on the quality of the benefactor. And the quality of the benefactor is determined by the value of the girls and other material possessions in their Harem. Harems tokens can be used to purchase other Harems NFTs that would increase the value of your Harem i.e. live girls or other Harems girls NFTs. \n\nYour benefactor can be upgrade"
