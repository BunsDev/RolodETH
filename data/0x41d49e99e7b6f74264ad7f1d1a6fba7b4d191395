  "description": "Decentralized Bone Society (DBS) is an NFT collection that acts as an access key to a Virtual Social Experience, called The Tavern. Your skull becomes your 3D In-Game character where you can meet other skulls, play games, customize your space, be a part of a DAO and much more.\n\nDBS is the first partner with ChainRail, a project that aims to take this vision into all the noteworthy NFT collections, creating a virtual platform where different communities can interact, bringing their own unique identities and cultures, in a MMO social-game style."
