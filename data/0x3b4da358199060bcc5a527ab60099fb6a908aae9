  "description": "Clash of Streamers has fully moved to Polygon. This means all your old tokens (PRPS, DUBI) and NFT's have been replicated (forked) on Polygon. You still own them on the same address, just on Polygon instead of Ethereum and can find them in the new collection. This collection is the old Ethereum version which is now deprecated and no longer officially used.\n\nClash of Streamers is a fully free-to-play mobile RPG on the iOS App Store and Android Play Store which allows players to export heroes and pets to the blockchain. Clash of Streamers Heroes can be used to take on other players in PvP, they can be empowered, made stronger and rented to other players for the token DUBI."
