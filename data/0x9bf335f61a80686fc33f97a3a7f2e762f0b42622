  "description": "\nWe are wasting time, energy, and resources trying to find the simplest single-cell creatures buried under icy Martian north pole glaciers, minuscule isopoda doing acrobatic stunts in spiralling Enceladus geyser jets, or primitive plants in the creases of Europa icy ground. In such an early stage of advancement in human’s evolution, we are so ignorant that we’ve never even tried to dig deeper than our own graves to find the true origin of humankind. Are we what we believe we are? Or are we just an ant farm abandoned a long time ago by a supreme being we call God?\n\nFew people ask: are we alone in the universe? Or somewhere out there other intelligent beings or entities are looking up into their sky asking the same question? Are there civilisations more advanced than ours? Or are there civilisations that have achieved interstellar communication and have established a network of linked societies throughout our universe?\n\nThe answer is still beyond reach….\n"
