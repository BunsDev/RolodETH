  "description": "MUMBOT is excited to drop the 100 GHOSTS project on Coinbase NFT. The collection features expressive, ghost-themed handmade artworks originally painted w/mixed media on 8\"x10\" canvas & slight digital enhancements. The ghost, MUMBOT's main character Aughostus, has a backstory in the MUMBOT WORLD lore. Aside from storytelling elements - this collection explores freedom in the creation process with an expressive & experimental approach to each unique piece."
