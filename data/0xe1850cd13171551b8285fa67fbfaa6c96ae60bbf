There are 19,999 Cool Pets--9,999 for Cool Cats holders and 10,000 for public mint.\r\n\r\nCooltopia is the Cool Cats ecosystem, including all of the components within Cool Cats that talk to one another: the Cool Cats NFT collection, Cool Pets NFT collection, the gamified and tokenized economy driven by $MILK, the questing system, the Cool Shop and marketplace, etc. Over time, weâ€™ll add to and grow Cooltopia, making the experience for our holders more and more fun, interesting, and rich."
