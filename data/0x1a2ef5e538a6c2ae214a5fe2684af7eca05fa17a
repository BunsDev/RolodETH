  "description": "\nThe Realm of Mu\n\nNobody knows how old the realm of Mu is, but if legends are true, it existed before time. A truly eternal place. What is known is that very few have visited this realm, and what they’ve reported experiencing is inexplicable. As though so overwhelmed by the beauty of this place, people find it difficult to retain any memory of their visit…\n\nThe realm consists of many fluid layers. Comprised of what man believes to be nothing short of a manifestation from the mind of a God. The Realm is guarded by what are called ‘Bridgers’. Supernatural entities who guide others through this energy realm."
