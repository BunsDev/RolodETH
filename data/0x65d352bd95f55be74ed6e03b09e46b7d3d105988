  "description": "SYZYGY is a multimedia collection of 66 1/1 Polaroids exploring the union of the Anima & the Animus. Regardless of gender identification - our psyche is androgynous, containing both yin and yang, both masculine and feminine qualities. These qualities tend to become repressed through the societal standards of our persona. Jung defines the Anima as the feminine (yin) within every man, and the Animus as the masculine (yang) within every female. Jung believes that individual integration of our anima/animus is necessary to properly relate to both ourselves and others within the world at large. For this collection artists Emily Swift and Jest have collaborated to personify these archetypes. The female model has integrated her Animus, and the male model has integrated his Anima. Together they from a divine union- SYZYGY. Collectors of this collection will be entered into an on-chain raffle for the opportunity to claim a handmade piece by the artists as either the physical or as an NFT."
