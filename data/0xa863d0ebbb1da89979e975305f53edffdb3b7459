  "description": "Rockbunn is a bunch of 3,333 unique wanna be rockstar bunns. The bunns are living and pursuing music careers on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC721 tokens. Some are funky, some are naughty while some are a little bit on the edge, but all are full of passion to express their rock spirit on stage. They are waiting for you as a Band Manager to pick them up, help them shine and pursue the dream together."
