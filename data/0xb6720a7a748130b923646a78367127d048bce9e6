  "description": "Miners of the Merge is a special event NFT to commemorate the Ethereum Merge. When the Merge occurs, Ethereum will stop using Proof of Work mining to create new blocks. To match this occasion, Miners of the Merge NFTs can only be created by mining them first, and after the Merge, no new tokens will be made.\n\nA portion of Mint costs are set aside for a prize, and the person who mints the last token before the Merge will be able to claim this prize. The exact time of the Merge is unknown, it could occur at any time but is expected to occur by mid-September.\n\nEvery token minted also receives a portion of the mint fees from all subsequently minted tokens, and that ETH can be withdrawn by the owner of the token."
