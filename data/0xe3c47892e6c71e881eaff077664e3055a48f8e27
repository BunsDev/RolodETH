These Beasts are all about community and being good-looking. \n\nOn the journey to attain good fashion sense, our beasts are able to reroll their clothing, accessories and facial features utilizing the currency within their own ecosystem and nearby species where they import from. \n\nHowever, as time went on [ r e d a c t e d ] destroyed the jungle and burnt most of it down, our Beasts are left to fend for themselves against great odds. Having their numbers dwindled down in the hundreds, the surviving tigers reap multiple times the benefits of what resources remain as there are less mouths to feed. \n"
