  "description": "Tin Lizards is a collaboration between photographer Robert LeBlanc and 96 Studio, the first of our commissioned projects underwritten by a select group of collectors. Ticket can be minted at https://app.manifold.xyz/c/tin-lizards.\n\nBeginning October 1, Robert will begin this 5-month photographic journey by way of the routes of the Amtrak railways. Shot strictly in black & white with the Leica Monochrom camera, a black and white novel of images- experiences that can only be made by train, taking viewers on a personal journey across the American heartland.\n\nTin Lizards is a commissioned drop, limited to 10 collectors. The holder of this Ticket Token will receive four images from the collection of 45 photographs. Collectors will have an interactive role and front row seats in the process of creating this body of work, voting on strategy, planning and executing each Amtrak trip. \n\nDetails at https://96studio.xyz/robert-leblanc"
