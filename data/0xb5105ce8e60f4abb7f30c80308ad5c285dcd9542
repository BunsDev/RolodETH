  "description": "The year is 2088 in the world. The first crypto trillionaire dies and leaves all his trillion-dollar capital and business to his youngest son. However, to receive the entire inheritance, he must prove that he is worthy to be the heir of such an empire.\n\nNot knowing how to build a new empire alone, he guesses to call other 8,887 heirs of the same deceased trillionaire from the parallel universes. TrillioHeirs team up to create the ZAM.DAO together, which includes ZAMpad, Zamio Ventures, and Zamio Incubator on the base of Zamio dApps."
