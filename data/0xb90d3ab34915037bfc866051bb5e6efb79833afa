  "description": "Andreas Wannerstedt is a Stockholm based digital artist and art director who crafts unique 3D sculptures and mesmerizing looping animations. The imagery of Andreas is both sophisticated and whimsical, and his synchronised animations has often been described as “oddly satisfying”, since the overall effect often evokes a strangely hypnotizing feeling. It’s all about interactions between shape and space, a portal into the perfect world of physics, movement, and predictability. During the last 15 years he’s been doing commissioned work for many of the worlds most recognisable brands and his animations have fascinated millions of viewers around the world."
