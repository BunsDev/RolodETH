  "description": "Devil Chicks is a NFT collection of 2666 characters living in Metacity. All of them different, some rare and few are absolutely epic and hot. \n\nFocused on art, creativity and build community around it. Our project contains three collections,  that will be released one by one. Devil Chicks, Night Chicks, and Holy Chicks. They are united by Lore and storyline. First one is Devil Chicks with low supply and friendly price. Next two will be bigger, but each holder Devil Chicks NFT will receive Night Chicks for free by airdrop. \n\n10% of all our income will be donated to charity. \n\nIn the case of the sold out our second collection Night Chicks NFT, weâ€™ll do moneyback for everyone who minted Devil Chicks NFT and hodl them until the moment!"
