  "description": "The season 1 drop for The Runners is 1000 hand drawn, unique and individual mints that will tell the story of our first faction within our blockchain universe. We are a community driven project that allows holders to have an impact within the projects core ecosystem. We are looking to build a DAO based community, where NFT holders get to make decisions about how the project moves forward over time. This is a very large task, but using a ranking system on discord, we will be able to value long term holders, increase or decrease their ranking by their quality and quantity of holdings and then give adequate voting rights fairly"
