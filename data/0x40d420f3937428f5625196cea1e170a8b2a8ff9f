  "description": "Total 10,000. Peppa Pig is a cute little pink pig who lives happily with her brother George, her dad, and her mom. Piggy's favorite things to do are playing games, dressing up, going on vacation, and living in a small mud puddle and jumping up and down happily. In addition to these, she also likes to explore everywhere, although some times will encounter some small situation, but always can be turned into a safe, and will bring everyone unexpected surprises."
