  "description": "https://www.identitiesbysketcha.com\n\nIdentities is about us. \n\nWe are all exploring a new digital era, discovering day by day its risks and its benefits.\n\nIn our blockchain tour we can easily change our identity, pretend to be someone else or even get our identity stolen.\n\nWith this Collection I want to bring to life a visual art concept with my painting style. A total of 700 traits have been randomly mixed together with a python code to generate unique Identities.\n\nThe result I wanted to achieve was a realistic and rough art portrait, valuable because of its uniqueness, where the emotions and the stories of each components give back to the viewer a visual artwork of the new reality we are now witnessing.
