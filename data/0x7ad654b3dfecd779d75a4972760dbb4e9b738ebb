  "description": "Time Travelers is a collection of 1,440 unique hand drawn time-bots which showcase the history of humanity in a 2D cartoonist style of artwork. Each Time Traveler represents each minute of every day, and is divided into 12 hours (different time periods of humanity). The style of artworks demonstrates that even though the scenery and articles around humans have progressed throughout time, we are the same as our ancestors."
