  "description": "This collection aims to reward early collectors of The Infinity Machine Movie Collection.\nAn agreement to develop and produce the movie on ethereum based on Camila Russo's book The Infinite Machine with Ridley Scott's production company Scott Free was announced on the 21st of April.\n\nA snapshot was taken before the announcement.\nBearing in mind the spirit of decentralization, we believe early supporters must be rewarded, thus we have conducted a free NFT airdrop for all holders of the TIMM Collection for wallets spotted in the mentioned snapshot.\n\nFor the first time in TIMM history, all NFTs will carry Movie Rarity Traits, allowing holders to appear in the movie as Extras, tour the Shooting, or be invited to the Premiere, as well as have their names appear in the movie credits.\n\nPieces for this new sub-collection, called \"Early WAGMAM\", have been designed by the artist Sasha Katz and curated and coordinated by Gladys Garrote;\n\n\"The Jewelled Arena\""
