  "description": "Meyohas initially conceived her Speculations series of photographs for Bitchcoin, a cryptocurrency as an artwork that playfully examines how value is created. The coin needed to be backed by a photograph, and the photograph needed to create value visually, deliberately, and perhaps with an illusory expansion of space to reference “mining” and the idea of gold. The _Speculations_ series is ongoing. After all, these images literally never end, given their perspectival depth."
