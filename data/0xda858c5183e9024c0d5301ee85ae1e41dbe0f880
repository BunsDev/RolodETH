Just mfing vibes!\nFor more about us go to: linktr.ee/MferChicks \n\nLike Sartoshi said, “there is no king, ruler, or defined roadmap--and mfers can build whatever they can think of with these mfers”.\n\nAfter reading those lines, my best friend and I decided to build this project for all the females that are badass mfers. With our network, we will uplift and support other females in the Web3 space. "
