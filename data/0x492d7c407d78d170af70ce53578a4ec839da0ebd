  "description": "Sun Signals is comprised of 1010 works by conceptual artist Kevin Abosch, informed by analysing sun cycles and solar radiation on Earth. The work is both a celebration of the star that powers all life processes on Earth while reminding us of the lethal spectre of climate change precipitated by industry. Sun Signals are generated \"off the grid\" using the artist's solar-powered computer servers. The images and metadata are stored on Arweave's Permaweb."
