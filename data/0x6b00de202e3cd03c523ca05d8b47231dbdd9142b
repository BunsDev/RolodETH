  "description": "Links: https://linktr.ee/TSRocketfactory\n\nTom Sachs Rocket Factory is a trans-dimensional manufacturing plant: we use NFTs to build new NFTs. Visit: [Mars Rocks Collection](/collection/tom-sachs-mars-rocks), [Components Collection](/collection/tom-sachs-rocket-factory), [Patches Collection](/collection/tom-sachs-rocket-factory-patches-) and [Tickets Collection](/collection/tom-sachs-mothership-tickets).\n\nThis is a collection of Assembled Rockets. Only 1000 Rocket NFTs will be minted into existence, and each is given a unique name by Tom Sachs. Rockets may be Assembled from Component NFTs in the Rocket Factory Component Collection.\n\nRockets without a ‘Flame’ or ‘Pending’ graphic may still elect to launch at https://tomsachsrocketfactory.com/launch Choose a launch date and pay a fixed fee of 0.1 ETH. Tom Sachs Rocket Factory will then build and launch a “meat-space” Physical Rocket. Once launched, the completed Rocket NFT, its Physical Rocket twin, and the Video documenting its launch form a Holy Trinity; all owned by you.\n\nRocket NFT holders will gain special access to future Tom Sachs Rocket Factory phases."
