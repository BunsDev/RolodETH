  "description": "100/100 Usagis have been made.  #000 - #099\n(+ some Not For Sale special pieces)\n\nUSAGI is a Japanese word for Rabbit.\nI first created this guy back in 2008, \nI was so much into Kaws, Bape , Madsaki, Bearbrick...all those Japanese street and cartoon styles, and got so much influenced, that was how we have the current Usagi. Still in love with him, finally more than excited to have him remade.\n\nUSAGI NFT Collectible. \nThis is my personal project with each piece handmade, 100 PCS IN TOTAL.\n\nUnlockables are included owners will get their avatar, images, and more.\nLet's own a unique Usagi now."
