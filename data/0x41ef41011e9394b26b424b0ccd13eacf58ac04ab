  "description": "100 years later, the Ice Age suddenly arrives and threatens humanityâ€™s survival. A set of mysterious quantum signal is sent to the government on earth. The deciphered message shows a blueprint of a climate controller, and every component has a multiverse coordinate attached to it. To obtain all the components of the climate controller, scientists on earth build a kind of cyborg named Otoko and send them on a mission to travel across multiverses to fight for the fate of humanity.\n\nEach Otoko NFT will serve as a special pass to Otoko Metaverse in the next stage. To build climate controllers, Otokos need to collect the blueprints of components and they can also craft their gear and artifacts by upgrading modules to increase the likelihood of collecting rare blueprints."
