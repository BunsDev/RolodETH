  "description": "ROMA is a documental essay of our recent history. It shows the year of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic in the city of Rome.\nIt reveals a time immersed in solitude, anguish, melancholy, fear, but also hope in one of the most impressive cities in the planet. It tells about a foreign woman and her camera in this apocalyptic moment in a city where old and new blend together. It is about leaving behind our fast-paced lives. It is about who we are, our frailties, our courage, our human condition."
