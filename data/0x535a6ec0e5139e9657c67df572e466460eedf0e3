  "description": "A long time ago, when there were no people on earth, our world had been inhabited by Yeti. There were eight races. So, they lived in North America. If you have ever heard that humans descended from monkeys, that is false. The world started itself with Yeti. Soon, you will see how the history of our planet really evolved.\n\nhttps://medium.com/@blacktigerback/yeti-fam-prehistory-a6300a9af152"
