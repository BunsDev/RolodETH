  "description": "Enter Inferno -- a decentralized play-and-earn PvE/PvP game set in a dark fantasy adaptation of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. Inferno delivers a gritty, narrative-driven, battle arena experience with an emphasis on skill-based competitive gameplay, which is reinforced by a player-driven crafting economy. Unlock elemental powers, craft powerful items to use in battle, and level up your character as you fight for the glory of Heaven or Hell.\n\nInferno Genesis Keys are a collection of 12,000 early-adopter NFTs that correspond to one of the twelve Zodiac Signs (the “classes” in Inferno). These Keys unlock premier features of the Infernoverse at every stage of development, beginning with the exclusive Genesis Armor Set. Visit www.infernoverse.com for more details."
