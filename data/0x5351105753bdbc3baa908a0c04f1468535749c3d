  "description": "Conceived in early January 2021, RUDE BOYS is the ongoing brainchild of esteemed Norwegian artist, Trym Ruud.\r\n\r\nHaving originally began the series as a vehicle for self reflection, Ruud swiftly recognized the potential for the universal nature of RUDE BOYS to resonate with others on a broader scale.\r\n\r\nMany of the collectibles are concerned with exploring serious, sincere matters - love, life and loss, to name but a few. Yet others operate on a purely whimsical level, encouraging the viewer to retain a sense of humour as well as perspective.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the collection is intended to explore aspects of the human condition whilst embodying the life-affirming mantra of its creator - \"Stay inspired and stay curious\"\r\n\r\nJust as human society continues to develop, so too does the RUDE BOYS family, piece by thought-provoking piece."
