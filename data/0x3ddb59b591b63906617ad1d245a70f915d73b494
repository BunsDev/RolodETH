Each month a new Egonaut will be released with 101 pieces of original artwork dedicated to that specific personality. Every Egonaut will be minted as a one-of-one NFT. The release period will span 12 months featuring a total of 1,212 pieces with 12 different personalities.\n\nThe first series of 101 Egonauts will be released in February of 2022 and the final series will be released in January 2023 to complete the collection. Each series of 101 are handpicked from thousands of trait combinations and each series will feature a new Egonaut with its own unique traits.
