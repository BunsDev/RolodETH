  "description": "Rebel Racoons consist of 1,111 adorably pissed off racoons living on the Ethereum blockchain. No white paper, No vision, No promises. Just fun art and breaking rulez. Inspired by meme culture, anime, pop-culture and low-key passive aggression, obviously. If you like it, cool. If not, cool.\r\nWe don't need your approval.\r\n\r\nOh. And we're freemint."
