  "description": "Skateboarding is a discipline like no other, some people call it a sport but I like to think of it as a way of expression. Very much like generative art, it is very technical yet creative and requires a lot of practice and dedication to master. In this project I want to show the beauty lying behind some of the most popular tricks by using the skateboardâ€™s movement as input to generate 3D moving real-time sculptures // Every iterations are WebXR enabled and can be viewed in immersive VR and AR // Drag to rotate around the scene, press S to take a hi-res screenshot // 25% of primary sales will be distributed to The Skatepark Project, The Water Project and the Mozilla Foundation //"
