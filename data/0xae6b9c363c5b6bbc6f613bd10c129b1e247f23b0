  "description": "Genies are official avatars for the world’s biggest icons. These tastemakers use their Genies to memorialize life defining moments. For the first time ever, Genies is bringing a consumer first approach to digital art & collectibles, providing real world utility to NFTs - Genie NFTs unlock Rare Genie Wearables for you to adorn your own Genie and bring them wherever you go. Own a piece of culture.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Genies’ Origin Collection with Mesut Özil featuring Boss Logic, the first of 6 Curated Genies Collections. Mesut Özil’s transfer to Turkish football club Fenerbahce was a perfect homecoming. While he made his fame with renowned clubs Real Madrid and Arsenal, the global superstar’s heritage lies in Turkey. This collection pays homage to Mesut’s past through the touches of red that represent his time with Arsenal, but it’s the new chapter that shines through with the iconic elements of Fenerbahce’s uniform. The devout fans of Mesut will recognize his own personal logo as the centerpiece, but the final touch is his uniform number of 67 - the postal code of his ancestral hometown in Turkey."
