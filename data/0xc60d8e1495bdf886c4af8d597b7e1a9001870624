  "description": "idotdotdots are inversed dotdotdots, strange cultish creatures that live inside solidity. An owner of a dotdotdot accidentally negative imaged his NFT, and realised how cool it looked.\n\nidotdotsdots can be minted directly from the contract using the mint function with a price of 0.05 ETH, up to a max of 5 per transaction. Each idotdotdot you get will be an inverse of a fully random dotdotdot. There will be 4360 idotdotdots initially for mint, but will increase with the supply of dotdotdots as the all time high price of Ethereum rises, with a cap of 10,000."
