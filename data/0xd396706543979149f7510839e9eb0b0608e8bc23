Humankind has vanished. Reptiles appear to be the new sole inhabitants of earth. An abandoned city, aka Karma City, fueled by a mysterious karmic power source sustained only by good vibes has been claimed by a group of chill lizards known as the Karmeleons, hellbent on looking fly and paying it forward.\n\nKarmeleons is a collection of 3333 randomly generated NFTs on ETH, focused on spreading good vibes throughout the NFT community. Each mint plants a tree. Holders own 100% commercial rights and can claim 1 free Karmz NFT per Karmeleon held.\n\nBe sure to also check out the [Karmeleons Originals](https://opensea.io/collection/karmeleons-originals) 1/1 collection."
