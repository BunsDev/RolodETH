  "description": "At the dawn of the universe, there was chaos. Then there was TARTARUS. Below Hades lies a dark abyss. As far below the earth as Elysium is above. A vast chasm, both dismal and dank. A place of decay. A place of entombment for the Titans who would dare to defy the odds, and the mortals who have committed the most unforgivable of sins â€“ souls deemed impious and unjust by Judges of the Dead. Sentenced to be eternally damned. TARTARUS is calling. The punishment will fit the crime."
