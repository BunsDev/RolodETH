  "description": "Nucleus is a procedural crypto-art project, mathematics moves points around a nexus point like subatomic particles around a nucleus, forming accidental geometric patterns. The appearance and movement of each token is driven by a unique hash, no two are the same. Best viewed in motion as a live script."
