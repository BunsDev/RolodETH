  "description": "The RR/BAYC collection was deemed \"possibly fake\" by the NFT Marketplace X2Y2. What is a fake NFT?\n\nThe artist Ryder Ripps re-contextualized the BAYC to draw attention to the problematic imagery and coded messages while also displaying you can't copy an NFT. This mint represents a historical moment in NFT history where centralized marketplaces are determining what NFT's are real or not.\n\nI wanted to support the artist Ryder and his movement but unfortunately my art has been labeled fake. This is only the beginning of the true decentralization that's coming. Are you ready?\n\nRRBAYC.com\nApemarket.com\nGordonGoner.com"
