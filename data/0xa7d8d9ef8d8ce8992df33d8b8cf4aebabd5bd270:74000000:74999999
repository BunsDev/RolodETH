  "description": "This project is dedicated to Art Blocks. Each panel on the block is a small generative art piece with several random parameters that lives its own life, at the same time being part of the composition. This symbolizes generative artists united by the common idea of ArtBlocks. Each art contains one letter of the words ART BLOCKS. A collector who possesses all nine letters becomes a member of The Blocks of Art Club and receives the opportunity to do a free mint of Shvembldr's projects on Artblocks Playground before the official release for a year, as well as other bonuses and perks"
