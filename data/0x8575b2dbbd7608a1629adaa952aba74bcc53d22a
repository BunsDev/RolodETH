  "description": "Humans of NFT is a collection of 1500 unique characters who call the Ethereum Blockchain home.  Each Human has a hand-crafted backstory, contributed by a member of the community through our Authors Program. In total, we collected over 80,000 words (that's more than your average novel) to create totally unique personalities for the Humans.  This collection is an extension of the original 229 Humans who were minted in March of 2021.\r\n\r\nHumans from the original genesis collection (https://opensea.io/collection/humansofnft-genesis) can be burned to claim their replacements for this new collection at https://humansofnft.com"
