  "description": "Toppy Eton is a self-taught digital fine art painter creating hauntingly gorgeous quiet surreal fever dreamlike artworks full of beauty, darkness, satire, memes, symbolism and layers upon layers of shrouded allegory reminiscent of Renaissance and Baroque-era style oil painting realism aesthetics inspired by master portrait artists like Rembrandt and Artemisia Gentileschi. She is also equally inspired by modern art avant-garde movements including Dadaism and Surrealism as well as sci-fi/fantasy and current contemporary internet meme culture.\n"
