  "description": "**On-chain art, summoned by you.** Hashrunes are the **first on-chain named** pieces of generative art. The **name, design, and colors** of each Hashrune all live **completely on the blockchain**. Each **NFT** (non-fungible token) is born from the **unique name** given by its creator. No two Hashrunes are alike. Once a name is claimed, its Hashrune **can't** be minted again. Hashrunes are **very scarce** due to an increasing minting fee. There are two editions: **Genesis Hashrunes** are the original Hashrunes with a pure design. **First Edition Hashrunes** have a corner design that distinguishes them from Genesis Hashrunes. They have a maximum supply. Genesis owners can mint their First Edition versions for free (other people can't mint them). To mint, visit **[Hashrunes.com](https://www.hashrunes.com)**."
