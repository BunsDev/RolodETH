  "description": "“Painted Cities” explores the memory and dream state of a city through the fusion of motion and ink. The digital paintings are created using a unique technique Mohler's been researching, which includes multiple forms of Ai especially Neural Style Transfer to fuse videos with ink, texture, and photographs. Mohler hopes these pieces further the digital art movement and open the eyes of traditional collectors to digital mediums that are conceptual, thought provoking, and engaging. It often takes weeks of testing and research before discovering perfect synergy between motion and texture.\n\nFor this series the process consists of first going out and filming moments around New York. Mohler seeks \"moments with high levels of motion and architecture.\"  Images are processed with neural style transfer and a particular set of rules to apply the textures and colors to the base texture of the input video, creating completely new imagery.\n\nHarnessing the machine as a tool to imagine.\n\n\n\n"
