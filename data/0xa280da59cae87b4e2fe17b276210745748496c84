  "description": "The images in this collection gravitates around the relationship between the physical space where things happen; the representational space of photography where those things are depicted and the mental space of the viewer. While anchored in the factual world, these photographs explore the evanescent constitution of reality and its interchanges with the notion of the world as an image."
