  "description": "Haze Monkey Society is an NFT collection aimed at empowering NFT creators and artists by collaboratively building a no-code platform whilst encouraging climate consciousness and offsetting carbon footprint through tree planting.\n\nWe are also making a community-driven animation series, where the holders will vote and get rewarded for participating in the production process. \n\nIn line with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, Haze Monkey Society is planting over 420,000 trees over the next 5years by collaborating with the community, experts, and existing green organizations to make this possible."
