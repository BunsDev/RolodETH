  "description": "Enchiridion is inspired by the Enchiridion Physicae Restitutae by Jean D'Espagnet which rejected the idea of the empyrean, claiming that all natural things exist in unity. This is represented through geometric forms which show structure, unity, and causation vs. the amorphous forms of Empyrean."
