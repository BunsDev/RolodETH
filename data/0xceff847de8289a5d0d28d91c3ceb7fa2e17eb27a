Please be sure you’re viewing on this Voucher on [Solv Protocol](https://app.solv.finance) for details when you make offer or purchase it.**\n\nSolv Protocol is the decentralized platform for creating, managing, and trading Financial NFTs. As its first Financial NFT product, Vesting Vouchers are fractionalized NFTs representing lock-up vesting tokens, thus releasing their liquidity and enabling financial scenarios such as fundraising, community building, and token liquidity management for crypto projects. \n\nSolv has distributed its mainnet vesting tokens $SOLV as Vouchers to our strategic partners through strategic partnerships. All Vouchers now can be traded on Solv’s internal marketplace or external NFT exchanges such as Opensea. Vhigh is the Vesting Voucher minted by our partner Highstreet."
