  "description": "\"Glitch Memories is my own smart contract.\"\n\nMemories aren't exact records of events. Instead, memories are reconstructed in many different ways after events happen, which means they can be distorted by several factors. In this collection, I wanted to bring my memories back with the help of some imagination and memory distortion."
