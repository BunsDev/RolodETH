  "description": "Soul Mates are 100% real human souls put on the blockchain for the very first time ever. Nearly 200,000 people have sold their souls to Liquid Death through legally binding contracts for all of eternity. Each NFT contains the rights to a real human soul whose ownership will be transferred from Liquid Death to the holder. And to commemorate the soul, each NFT also features a unique skull drawn by Will Carsola set overtop of the original soul contract. And the only way to get a Soul Mate in the initial mint is to hold 6 or more Murder Heads or one Super Rare Murder Head from Murder Head Death Club. "
