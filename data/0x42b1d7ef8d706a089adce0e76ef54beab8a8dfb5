  "description": "Godfrey Reggio’s creative process involves intensive note-taking where ideas, words, and images take shape. This process has been ongoing since the inception of his seminal documentary “Koyaanisqatsi” (1982). \n\n“Scriptomania” is the first release of these previously unpublished  works. They offer an unprecedented window into the mind of one of America’s greatest filmmakers."
