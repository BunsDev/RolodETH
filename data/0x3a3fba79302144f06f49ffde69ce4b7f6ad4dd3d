  "description": "[furbrawls.io](https://www.furbrawls.io/)\n\n[Super Tigers](https://opensea.io/collection/super-tigers)\n\nSuper Bunnies are rare generative hand-drawn superheroes sworn to defend our universe. Light Super Bunnies are opposed by their anti-hero counterparts the Dark Super Bunnies. The perfect balance for the universe. Yin Yang and the never ending battle between good and evil.\n\nA community-driven project, each bunny is your membership card and gives you a vote in our collective future: the first being how to forge our immersive ecosystem, where a slick multiplayer FPS game is already being explored â€“ one that allows people to fight as their bunny avatars and earn NFTs and tokens as they save humanity.\n\nStarting from a limited edition of 5K on the Ethereum chain, their origin story includes a deflationary breeding mechanism (burning Bunnies for even rarer creatures). Every bunny is uniquely made from over 150 different features - no unpopular attributes! 'GOD MODE' anyone?"
