  "description": "A collection of 5555 Galactic Tavern Aliens spread across 5 different species with varying traits makes the Galactic Tavern a variety filled safe haven for all species to relax and enjoy their free time with drinks, music and moaning about the market. No matter what intergalactic spaceforce is after you or how bad goblin town hits ya, you are safe as long as you are here. \n\nFrom time to time the GT leaves space for IRL Events - hope to enjoy free drinks with you there! Be sure to bring your GTA with your favorite drink."
