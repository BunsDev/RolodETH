  "description": "##### Memorial Stone\n\nThe [Memorial Stone](https://remember.place/mint-stone/) is a commemorative NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. There are 5,000 one-of-a-kind stones in total, each crafted delicately by our passionate artists and ready to be placed by you in the Remember Metaverse.\n\nEach Memorial Stone doubles as a key to a user’s private Memorial Hall, where they may store and display memories of their loved one as text, images, videos, sounds, 3D objects and more.\n\nAs a commemorative NFT, it is only natural that we provide a uniquely composed stone for our passed loved ones. No two Memorial Stones share the same composition. Unlike traditional tombstones that share many similarities in shape and color, each Memorial Stone is wonderfully individual - just like the loved one it represent\n\n##### Remember Metaverse\n[Remember Metaverse](https://remember.place) is the world’s first commemoration NFT in Metaverse.\nRemember forever the ones you loved that are no longer here with us today.\n\n"
