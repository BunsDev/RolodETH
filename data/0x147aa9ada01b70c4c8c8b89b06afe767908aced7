  "description": "We are building the world’s first ancient museum in the Metaverse, and you’re part of the family! PharaGoddess is a project composed of 3700 NFTs hand crafted by Matt Millard in collaboration with David Masson. We unified the most experienced people in the industry to deliver a remarkable, cutting edge product. We want all future generations to learn about Ancient Gods. Here’s the real long-term play…we are excited to share that ownership of a PharaGoddess NFT gives you fractional ownership of our Metaverse ancient museum. We are serious about growing and mobilizing this community, and this allows us the chance to continually give back to our earliest adopters. We could, perhaps, develop to a point where we rent & sell space in our Metaverse Museum to traditional museums seeking to expand virtually."
