  "description": "MetaVerse Punks\n\nMetaVerse Punks (MVPs) are unique 1 of 1 characters designed to roam the Metaverse with their distinctive traits. MVPs are the Genesis On-Chain collection within the Average Punk Universe.\n\nThe MVPs are the epitome of what the Metaverse should be - standing out from the crowd by simply being your very best self.  MVPs are proud to push the boundaries, be obscure, a bit outrageous, and secure in their weirdness.  They display to the world the beauty and horror of everyday life as a degen.\n\nEach meticulously crafted MVP begins as a full bodied 3D NFT.  The holder is also able to download the 3D and .glb files.   Further, each MVP will earn 10 $PZA every day, just for holding.\n\nSecondary Collection can be found here: https://opensea.io/collection/averagepunks-"
