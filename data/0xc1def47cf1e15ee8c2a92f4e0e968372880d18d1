  "description": "Interoperable 3D avatar platform to create, sell and trade avatars as NFTs. Avatars are VRM files and single-edition tokens on the Ethereum or Polygon (Matic) chains. All the avatars in our platform are licensed, making some of them accessible to anyone (Opensource - CC0). We bring avatar interoperability across Metaverse platforms such as VRChat, Decentraland, The Sandbox, Webaverse and many more to come. Use them for Vtubing and video calls too!"
