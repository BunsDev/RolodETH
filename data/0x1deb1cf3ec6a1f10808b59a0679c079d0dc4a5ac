  "description": "In 2015, a squad of 250 astronauts were deployed to the deep blockspace of ETH MainNet in search of mineable asteroids. Weeks later, contact was lost. All were presumed dead until today when we received strange transmissions from the edges of the event horizon known as The Merge."
