  "description": "The year is 2222\r\n\r\nHumanity is withering under constant threat and the population is dwindling…\r\n8 Billion has become 800 Million.\r\n\r\nThe planet is warming releasing new beings from viruses to relic bacterium formally trapped in Ice. Clean water is rare, everything is rationed. There are no more countries, the boundaries of land became frivolous rather quickly.\r\n\r\nEverything happens without warning. New threats emerge at every moment. The future is bleak. It seems the species has no weapon to wield. But a small group of women hailing from what used to be Italy, Germany, France and New Babylon Alaska are readying to fight.\r\n\r\nThey can tell and sometimes SEE the future, but for now it’s only a couple of days ahead. They are the last chance for the world. They are called “The Practitioners”\r\n\r\nThey number 5622.\r\nThey practice Tarocchi.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Rue Arcana](https://www.ruearcana.com/)"
