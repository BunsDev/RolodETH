  "description": "** SOCIETY OG COLLECTOR TOKENS CAN BE UPGRADED ONLY AT HTTPS://THESOCIETY.ART ** \n\nArt for Collectors. Collectors for Artists.\n\nThe Society is a private community capped at 5,000 members centered around the collection of art and elevation of incredible artists new to NFTs. Each quarter our Lead Curator introduces a talented artist who will be releasing their genesis NFT collection exclusively to our members. Holding a Society Collector Token is your only way to access these pieces, unless Collectors list on the secondary market.\n\nGold Collector Tokens come with extra perks: the chance to win 1 of 100 extra pieces per quarterly drop, a complimentary bonus mint from the  artist, and access to a special Discord channel.\n\nWe also have a money-back mint warranty built into our contract. If we don't sell 2000 tokens by Feb 18, 2022, all Collector Token holders will be eligible to claim a refund. <b>IMPORTANT: THIS WARRANTY ONLY APPLIES TO THE WALLET THAT CURRENTLY HOLDS THE TOKEN.</b>"
