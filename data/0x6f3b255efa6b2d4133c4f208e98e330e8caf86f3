Madness and mayhem have plagued the world since the 6 armed bebehs tore a hole in our reality! Can the Chimerapillars rescue their infantile cousins from the corruption of the lonely pillar?\n\nThis project continues the twenty-year history of artist and gallerist Jon Beinart's renowned doll sculptures, imbuing them with fresh psychedelic energy from award-winning artist and madman, Tim Molloy.\n\nToddlerpillar & Chimerapillar holders join an inter-dimensional art collective with access to global gatherings, exclusive airdrops, a 100+ page multimedia graphic novel exploring our lore, IRL collectable toys, metaverse exhibitions, merch & much more!"
