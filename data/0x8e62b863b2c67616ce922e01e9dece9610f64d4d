  "description": "Golamis is a collectible series of 100-120 unique characters created by RWR2 on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nhttps://rwr2.co/golamis\n\nSince I was a kid I love creating characters. I used to draw them on my school notebooks during classes and later I became a Character Designer in my professional career. I did hundreds, if not thousands, of characters for different clients and brands.\n\nIn the design and animation industry, I had to follow trends, shift between art styles and create the vision of others. My own characters were never suitable for most projects, no brand wants a hairy nipple representing their product. I always thought they deserved a place to shine, and I think I just found the perfect spot for them as a collectible series of NFTs.\n\nMeet Golamis! They were born out of bursts of raw creativity. No rules, no trends, no perfectionism. They represent my scream for artistic freedom, and I hope they can bring you joy!"
