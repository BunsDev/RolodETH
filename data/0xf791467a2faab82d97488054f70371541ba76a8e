  "description": "A series of 333 clean, abstract floral works inspired by Wassily Kandinsky and the Bauhaus school of early 20th century German art.\n\nThe procedural techniques used to generate these unique pieces inherit and extend the Bauhaus philosophy â€“ to meld the tools and techniques of mass production with a spiritual and singular artistic vision."
