  "description": "We are The Fugly. Art is the only valuable resource that Earth has to offer us. So we have captured two of your most precious artists - Blake Jamieson and MegZany.\n\nRest assured, Blake and Meg are having the time of their lives. Each NFT in this Vintage Genesis Collection is hand-painted by Blake and Meg. They have preformed obediently for The Fugly, so we have rewarded them with this opportunity to immortalize The Fugly on your adorable baby blockchain. You have so far to go, but congratulations on evolving your internet from a fetus to a toddler.\n\nThe Fugly OUT\n///\nNO DISCORD. NO ROADMAP. NO “UTILITY” YOU BOZOS!\nwww.fugly.app"
