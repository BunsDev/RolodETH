  "description": "Zombie Mob Secret Society is the industry’s first fully animated 3D NFT collection that features a protagonist that can walk, strut, run, flip, dance, and fly; following Zinu, the original Zombie, as he journeys across the Zombieverse. With a complex and compelling storyline for its character, the team aims to connect and empower the community to be part of a growing brand that can be used and commercialized from entertainment and gaming, to apparel, toys, and collectibles. Defiantly fearless, audacious to a fault, Zinu is continually haunted by something darker. What that is, currently, we don’t know, but partner we must, to help Zinu defeat it.
