  "description": "\"Tim Tadderâ€™s art is how I see music. I see music in color. The colors are good for the soul.\"   Timbaland, Acclaimed Music Producer and collector of 3 physical pieces. \n\n When primary colors are mixed at equal parts, black is ultimately the precipitating color. During the process, an imperial display of tones appears in the swirling to mirror powerful structure & emotion from the subjects. At a crucial time for the nation to unite, I hope this collection encourages empathy, unity & a non-binary view of race. Black is a color challenges one to see past profiling & foresee the beauty that is capable of elevating the human experience. Black is a color demands that we look past skin tone, & into beautiful, infinitely complex humans.\n100% of net proceeds of the sales of this project will go to support creators of African descent, 25% to the beautiful models 75% to artists creating meaningful work focusing on social justice.  Physical pieces are currently on display at Avant Gallery NYC.\n"
