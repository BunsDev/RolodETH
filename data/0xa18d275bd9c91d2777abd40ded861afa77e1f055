  "description": "The Owlies from the 5th Dimension are the genesis collection of the 5th Dimension community, consisting of 555 NFTs living on the Ethereum blockchain. \r\n\r\nEach NFT acts as a membership to our community of artists, musicians, writers, and other creators, who are building an Arts and Entertainment company in the form of a DAO. \r\n\r\nThe 5th Dimension will contain many different communities, or worlds. Each world is dedicated to a different area of arts and entertainment. There will be worlds for fine art, music, comic books, film, and more â€“ even discovering new genres that are possible because of NFT technology. Your Owlie NFT gives you access to them all, and opportunities to obtain NFTs from these future collections. \r\n\r\nJoin us and enter into this parallel dimension to help create a new decentralized economy that is separate and distinct from the global centralized economy and its corrupt power structures."
