  "description": "The Toadz got high, f*cked around and created a wormhole somewhere in the swamp. They all fell in, now they're stuck in a parallel swamp that's saved on some crappy PC in the past. You can retrieve them, but not without corrupting the toadz.jpeg\n\nCorruptedToadz are created using a manual unique process of rendering an image on an old PC emulator and tinkering with the image source code to produce an actual corrupted toad with the look of an old school computer graphic.\n\nExclusively available to CrypToadz holders: 1 CrypToadz = 1 CorruptedToadz\n\nConfigure your CorruptedToadz: https://www.corruptedtoadz.com"
