These monks get really high and put on different outfits for no reason. There’s no telling what these big doink smokers will wear . Sometimes, they eat too many edibles and morph forms. They are costumes/hoodies and not the characters. It’s high monk cosplay, and its high monk parody PFP art. It’s satire. It’s laughable, wonky, and relatable.\n\nMonks will be multiple varieties of colors, forms, objects and rarities, cause it’s cool. We strive to serve this community with the upmost respect. \n\nI’m the only person making this. I really like to chill, listen to music, and create. This is a great release for me, and has changed my life. Most profit will go towards helping my family, community, and those around me. I say most, because if I want an oreo mcflurry from mcdonalds, Im getting one.\n\nUnmigrated: https://opensea.io/collection/crypto--monks"
