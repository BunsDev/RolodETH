  "description": "**The holder count on Opensea is not accurate as many NFTs are staked for gameplay. **\n\n\nRabbits and Foxes go head-to-head on-chain for the enticing prize of CROWN. You decide your fate in Fox Game. Around the farm, an abundance of rabbits and foxes scurry to harvest carrots, however, the farm has grown too big and new threats of nature have entered the game.\n\n\n**CROWN is the utility token of Fox Game and it is only used for gameplay. The development team does not sell or provide value to this token other than it being used for playing Fox Game.**\n\n\n\n\nPlay: https://www.fox.game/ \nDiscord: https://www.discord.gg/foxgame\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/OfficialFoxGame"
