  "description": "Holy Rock NFT is an exclusive community project that combines the business world and technological progress with Jewish faith and spirit. The basis for the project is a globally unique and first-of-its-kind initiative: using digital technologies to create accurate detailed imaging of the Western Wall stones. The stones of the Western Wall are thousands of years old. Each stone has its own distinctive appearance, dimensions, weight, shape, and age. Some of the stones are particularly prominent and rare, due to their gigantic dimensions or the unusual inscriptions embedded in them. There is a limited amount of only 2357 Holy Rocks available.\n\n\nWebsite: https://holyrocknft.com/ \nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/kHazEY9m3V\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/holyrocknft\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/holyrocknft"
