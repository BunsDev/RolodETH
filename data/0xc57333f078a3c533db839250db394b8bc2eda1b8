  "description": "Iceland... The land of fire, ice, aurora, and free spirit. After almost a decade spent exploring Iceland, Iurie Belegurschi is releasing his genesis series. Four sacred elements, Fire, Water, Air, and Earth. One majestic Iceland. The genesis drop is 25 heat-infused pieces of fiery volcanoes, all edition of 1/1.\r\n\r\nNo less than four drones were lost by Iurie trying to capture these images, the feisty fire and heat from the volcano destroyed the camera lenses and propellers. Collectors from all corners of the world cherish photos from Iurie, including the President of Iceland, Guðni Thorlacius Jóhannesson, himself.\r\n\r\nUnlock the fifth element, the Mysterious Ether, when you collect one NFT of each element.\r\n\r\nIn the end, just 100 basic elements are to be collected."
