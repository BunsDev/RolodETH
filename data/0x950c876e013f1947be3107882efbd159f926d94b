  "description": "Witch Hearts are generative messages of love (“Memento Amoris”) uniquely created for the ethereal, weird and wild WITCHES of Crypto Coven. Each Memento Amoris is unique, with a non-fungible token (NFT) stored on the Ethereum mainnet. Conjured on St. Valentine’s Day 2022, each Crypto Coven WITCH owner may mint their distinctive pair of Witch Hearts as an enchanting token of affection dedicated to their WITCH – to hold and to share.\n\nDedicated to our sister WITCHES of Crypto Coven, this hand-drawn, female-lead project is a love letter to all WITCHES on and off chain."
