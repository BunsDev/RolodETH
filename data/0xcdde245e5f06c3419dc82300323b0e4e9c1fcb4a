  "description": "There will only ever be 555 Eth-arely NFTs - OFFICIALLY SOLD OUT\n\nThe Eth-arely collection pays true respect to the mid 1900's Hungarian artist Victor Vasarely.\nHis artwork was the first of it's kind, utilising colourful geometric shapes to create warped three-dimensional realities. \n              \nThis showcase is primarily inspired from his collection 'Planetary Folklore Participations'.\n\nEvery piece in the collection is algorithmically generated, making each NFT a completely 1/1 gen art creation hosted on the ethereum blockchain. The Nfts will be equally priced at 0.02 Eth and will have appropriate metadata attributes based on size, category and rarity.  \n\nMax 1 NFT per transaction.\n\n"
