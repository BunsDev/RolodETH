  "description": "The 29 Palms Collections is the brainchild of [NiftyFilm](https://www.example.com) founder and filmmaker [Jason Charnick](https://www.upstartfilmcollective.com/). Every summer, Jason visits a remote location in the southern Mojave desert to organize, create and revitalize.\n\nIn 2022, his personal journey to [Twentynine Palms, California](https://www.ci.twentynine-palms.ca.us/) took a dark turn, as his extreme isolation led him to confront some of his deepest insecurities and the source of an unrelenting grief.\n\nThe result is the [29 Palms Collection](https://29palmscollection.world/), 29 1/1s, starting at 0.029 ETH with a mix of photography and aerial videography, in glorious 4K DCI CinemaScope complete with music and an atmospheric sound design.\n\nA portion of the proceeds of the initial sales of the collection will go to support [Forever Footprints](https://www.foreverfootprints.org/) and [The Absence is Always Present](https://absence.movie/) feature film project."
