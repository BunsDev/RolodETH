  "description": "**Reveal on 29th July! **[Anti-Bear Bear Club](https://abbc.studio/)(Twitter: @[abbcstudio](https://twitter.com/abbcstudio)) is a collection of 3,000 unique bears [last bear fighters in the universe] NFTs living on Ethereum. An anti-Bear NFT will be served as the membership certificate to ABBC, which believes all bears should get rekted.\n\nAfter all bears are minted, the ABBC DAO will be formed. The ultimate goal of this DAO is to fight “bearish” in any sense. We believe our community will eventually realize that the ABBC is the only and true bear fighter long lives on Ethereum. It is going to be a dope value discovery journey to all ABBC holders."
