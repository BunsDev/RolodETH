  "description": "Sudan\nOmdurman\nBrown dust, hot air\nBroken system, broken roads\nSweet sandalwood incense rising in smoke\nLadies wrapped in every color and every pattern\nMorning milk tea with cookies out under the mango tree\nHopeful graffiti of revolution on every street wall\nA thousand guests, a million cups of coffee\nThe two Niles converging at one point\nMixing, sorting, moving on North\nI will leave for my home soon\nBut I won't forget\nOmdurman\nSudan\n\nThis piece was made while I was visiting Sudan and during the time I started meetings to build a school using the charity money collected from all the amazing collectors of Sudfah.  I was inspired by the contrast between the ubiquitous dirt and broken system of Sudan and the beautiful colorful culture and people.  The colorful forms represent to me both the long flowy garments of the ladies and the smoke and aromas rising from the unique incense and perfumes of Sudan.\n\n25% of the proceeds will be donated toward building a school for an underdeveloped community in Sudan."
