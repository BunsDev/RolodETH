  "description": "Knit by Knit is a collaborative project created by generative artists Alex Supkay and Jake Rockland. In its naming, the project is evocative of the process of weaving â€“ an apt evocation given that this project represents the bringing together of multiple things. Aesthetically, Knit by Knit is the weaving together of two artists stylistic approaches to generative art. The piece also has a tapestry like quality to it with the foreground and the background both being inspired by that technique.\n\nThis coming together goes beyond stylistic collaboration with the majority of proceeds going to support the Ethereum Core Developers, Knit by Knit is a demonstration of artists coming together to support the broader ecosystem that they are a part of, woven into the history of the blockchain. Moments like The Merge are a culmination of ideas coming together to create something bigger like how individual threads create beautiful tapestries."
