  "description": "Especial Orbs is a limited generative art collection based off of an individual’s digital wallet address hash values. It takes the 20 values of your hash string and draws 20 circles (representative of those 20 values), places an element inside the circle and rotates that element by the value of your hash pair for that position (hash-pair-value * 1.411) to arrive at a value between 0-360 degrees. Each piece is a unique visual representation of your wallet hash values and the rotation of the inner element represents the 20 different values that are contained in your wallet’s hash string."
