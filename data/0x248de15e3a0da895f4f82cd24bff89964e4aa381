  "description": "This collection represents our first Collection of 5,492.  Collections 2 and onward can be found here: \nhttps://opensea.io/collection/9021-les-generatives-fine-arts\n\nIn Collection 1, 9021 was taking the first steps of generative art identity, allowing collectors to use the art as a static fitted Twitter header. Inspired and now in collaboration with Roni Kaufman's work.\n\n9021 is a generative fine art launch platform that embodies the modern art movement also known as “Pop Art”. Created in the 1950s “Pop Art” uses the imagery, styles, and themes of advertising, mass media, and popular culture. 9021 is a beautiful balance between the originality of Pop Art and the concise constraints of generative art."
