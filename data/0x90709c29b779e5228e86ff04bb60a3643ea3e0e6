  "description": "Boss Logic is a giant in the entertainment industry, from humble beginnings, creating \"fan art\" and posting on social media, he is now regularly commissioned by Marvel and DC to create art for their movies. He's become so influential that the studios even take notice of his \"Fan Cast\" art where he will choose actors for characters and create his own \"mash up\" poster. In 2017 he created a work portraying Rosario Dawson as a character in The Mandalorian, it gained so much popularity that it got the attention of Rosario and the producers that she actually landed the part!"
