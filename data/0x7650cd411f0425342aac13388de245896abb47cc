  "description": "NekoMiko is a collection of unique non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are made up of hundreds of design parts based on traditional Japanese 'omamori' (protection) charms. Each color and pattern has a deeper meaning, and can bring fortune to its owner in love, health, work and academics. We believe that this is an NFT that can be your good luck charm too! NekoMiko (Premium) will be voiced by Suzuko Mimori, a popular Japanese voice actress.\n\nWe love cats, and good deeds = good karma.\nSo 50% of primary sales will be donated to cat shelters!\n\nNo roadmap, but the cats might prepare some surprises."
