  "description": "The Genesis collection includes 10,338 NFTs created to protect the Amazon rainforest. Each NFT card is tied to real land in the rainforest through its unique geo-coordinates, and come in a variety of sizes. \n\nOn the backside of each card, there are four randomly generated features for biodiversity that exists within the underlying land. (One of these features will appear on the front of the card.) All four features combined will determine the overall rarity of a specific NFT - visible by the border of the card. \n\nSize, rarity, and features for each card will impact game and reward mechanics within Nemus as the project evolves. So hold onto your cards... Will you be able to collect every feature?\n\nAbout the Artwork: All legendary features for the Genesis collection were hand-drawn by Ben Kwok from Bioworkz, with all additional features created by Concept Art House."
