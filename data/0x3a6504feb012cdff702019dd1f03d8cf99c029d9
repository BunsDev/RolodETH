[Interactive Art](https://bit.ly/3dhgP5d)? [Generative Art](https://bit.ly/3cu5akm)? A [music player](https://bit.ly/2PBK9v2)? A [Drumbox](https://bit.ly/3rsdlC0)? An NFT you can really [interact with](https://bit.ly/3rtzSyp)? Or one that changes depending on [its owner](https://bit.ly/3d9qqe8)?\r\n\r\nAll those already exist and can be fully experienced on https://beyondnft.io\r\n\r\nJoin us to make some music, play some games or be amazed by live generative art!\r\n\r\nThis present collection is the one located on **Ethereum Mainnet**, but creators can create NFTs on Ethereum, Polygon (ex-Matic) or xDai, giving a lot of flexibility in term of network choice and minting costs (BeyondNFT takes the cost of minting on xDai and Polygon).\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyondNFT is an Open Platform, meaning anyone can mint. So please, never forget: Do Your Own Research"
