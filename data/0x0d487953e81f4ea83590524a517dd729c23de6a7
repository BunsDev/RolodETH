  "description": "BitPix NFTs are Historical Event trading cards since 2019. Each card captures a moment in time that depicts anything from pop culture, to world economic events and conspiracies. OpenSea decided to put a cap on this collection so there can now only be a max supply of 29 NFTs with each card being a 1/1 edition."
