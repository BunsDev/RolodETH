  "description": "Sarah doesn't like waking up in the morning, being productive, or dealing with social situations. “Scribbles” is a comic NFT collection that follows her life, finding humor in that which is weird, awkward, and embarrassing. This comic is for barely-functioning people, created by a barely-functioning person."
