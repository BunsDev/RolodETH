  "description": "Once considered the dominant Earth species, humans have been humbled by the arrival of the Akari and the knowledge that their home planet once belonged to a vastly more advanced race. No comfortable livelihood is left for any but the most elite, with the general populace forced to fight for their survival or otherwise support the war effort from the sidelines.\n\nOnly the prospect of surviving the Elarium resource war brings a slither of hope to humanity's grueling existence, as the promise of a new life on a new planet, free from war, looms on the horizon. \n\n##Origin NFTs benefits\n- \n- In-game $ELAR rewards\n- In-game Earn Boost\n- Origin Skin Packs \n- Early Access\n- Claimable In-game Skins\n- Lending and sharing \n- Staking for $ELAR rewards \n- Private Holder Channel\n\n###Do you want to know more?\n\n Visit [https://litepaper.elarium.io/business-and-tokenomics/origin-nfts](https://litepaper.elarium.io/business-and-tokenomics/origin-nfts)"
