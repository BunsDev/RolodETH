For each OG boy you own you can mint an Alien UFO or a girl randomly for free (you only pay gas)   \n\n[The Alien Boy OG Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/thealienboy)    \n[The Alien UFO Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/thealienufo)  \n[The Alien Doogle](https://opensea.io/collection/thealiendoogle)  "
