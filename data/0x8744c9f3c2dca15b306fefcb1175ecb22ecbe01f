  "description": "Hello fam! is the official winery of the NFT age.\n\nBuy a Grape Fam NFT and you'll receive membership in the world's first NFT winery and tokenized ownership of one case (six 750ml bottles) of our upcoming Genesis Vintage 2021 wine release, which will be stored indefinitely in an insured, temperature-controlled facility and never sold outside of the NFT.\n\nTo promote inclusivity and enable fractional ownership, you will be able to purchase and trade Seedling NFTs, which are each backed by a single bottle of Genesis Vintage 2021. Collect and destroy 6 Seedling NFTs to redeem for a case of wine. Seedling NFTs will not have rarities attached, so in general it's better to buy a full Grape Fam. "
