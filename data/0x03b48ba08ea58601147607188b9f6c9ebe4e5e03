  "description": "Greg Loves Hats is an art-driven project featuring a collection of 1,234 Gregs rooted in community & positive vibes. \n\nGreg just opened a hat store. Only one problem; Greg hasn't had any customers yet, so he hasn't been able to share his love of hats with the world. Greg wants everyone to enjoy his hats, so he's giving them away for free!"
