  "description": "Shroom Scouts is a collection of badges for Magic Mushroom Clubhouse NFT holders who are pursuing this adventure. Owners of these badges have bragging rights, the ability to obtain future badges, and certain benefits within the Magic Mushroom Clubhouse community.  \n\nShroom Scouts was formed to gamify the ownership of NFTs and to build trust and relationships with other MMC members. It is an interactive journey that promotes teamwork, participation, and communication. There will be 5 different types of badges released: Community Badge, Campfire Badge, Charity Badge, Forage Badge, and Nobility Badge.\n\nEarning these badges will become more difficult to accomplish and each badge will become more scarce.\n\nThe 5 badges are listed in order of completion:\n(1) Community Badge\n(2) Campfire Badge \n(3) Charity Badge\n(4) Forage Badge\n(5) Nobility Badge\n"
