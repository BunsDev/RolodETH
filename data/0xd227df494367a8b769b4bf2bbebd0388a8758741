  "description": "[Degen’$ Farm](https://www.degens.farm) is a gamified NFT collectible tightly connected with DeFi culture. It's an experiment with skill-based distribution. There are 2420 unique creatures to be discovered, each has its own character, style and sound. They are 100% blockchain creatures and produce $DUNG and collect $ETH for their owners. If you want to farm next level creatures, you need [LAND](https://opensea.io/collection/degens-farm-lands) and after you deploy it with your creature in our [farming](https://degens.farm/farming) cabinet you receive an [EGG](https://opensea.io/collection/degens-farm-eggs). You can use [TOOLS](https://opensea.io/collection/degens-farm-tools) and other [farming tricks](https://docs.degensfarm.com/farming) to improve your farming probability. Come back in one week and see what you've got!\n\n“The more one sows – the greater the harvest!”\nChichi, Degen’$ Farm CEO"
