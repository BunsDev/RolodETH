  "description": "1,989 Sisters is the first NFT collection from fashion illustrator @blairz. \r\n\r\nEvery trait in this collection was hand-drawn or painted on paper, scanned and then layered through an algorithm to generate 1,989 women living on the Ethereum blockchain.\r\n\r\nThe collection includes a nod to ten of @blairzâ€™s favorite iconic fashion prints. No brands are affiliated, connected or associated in any way with 1,989 Sisters. The collection also includes eight sets of twins and one set of triplets. This was not by design, but a serendipitous accident as @blairz is a twin and was born in 1989, which was the inspiration for the collection name and number of Sisters.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit www.blairbreitenstein.com/nft-collection\r\n\r\nJoin our community on Discord: discord.gg/sisters"
