  "description": "Limah is an AI generated collection that is inspired by the works of Hilma af Klint. The Swedish artist is credited with creating some of the earliest known abstract paintings in history.\n\nThe Limah AI studied 5 pieces Adulthood No.6, Childhood No. 2, Youth No. 3, The Swan No. 17 and Adulthood No. 7 to generate the 334 Limah that exist on the ethereum blockchain today.\n\nLimah is the third collection of Tria Chromatica, an hommage to revolutionary artists."
