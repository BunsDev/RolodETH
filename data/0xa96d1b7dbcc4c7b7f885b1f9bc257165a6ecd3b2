  "description": "The Psytrance Pig Project houses 10,000 collectible Ethereum-based NFTs called the Psypigs, each of them being unique randomized combination of multiple parts of the 173 total traits from our carefully curated Psytrait pool. That means every single Psypig is unique. Owning a Psypig does not just mean you become part of the cool Psypig gang, but also unlocks a chain of secret membership perks which will be announced over time. Our future projects include music-oriented metaverse and music video NFTs during launch of Phase 2. Join our discord channel to learn more."
