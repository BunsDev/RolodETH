  "description": "Discover Your Immortality. Every Khoric citizen is a descendant of The Nineâ€”the original immortals whose essence echoes through the history of Khora. To become a player in the upper echelons of Khoric society, new immortals must be able to prove their provenance. This proof is found in what is known as an Aspect of The Nine. "
