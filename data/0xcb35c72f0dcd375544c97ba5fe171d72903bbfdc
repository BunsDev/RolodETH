  "description": "Welcome to the wonderfully weird world of Fuzzle! \n\nThe Lost Fuzzles are AI-powered “living” NFTs that can talk and play games. They were trapped in a void-like world called the Netherrealm, but were able to escape and make their way to Earth. Owning a Lost Fuzzle is your ticket into the Fuzzleverse–the world’s first Web3 amusement park filled with AI-powered games, interactive attractions, and earning opportunities.\n\nLinktree: https://linktr.ee/Fuzzle_Official\n\n\nOther Fuzzle collections:\n\nFuzzle: https://opensea.io/collection/fuzzle\n\nStowaways: https://opensea.io/collection/fuzzlestowaways\n\nFuzzle Accessories: https://opensea.io/collection/fuzzleaccessories\n\nSpace Cases: https://opensea.io/collection/fuzzle-space-cases\n\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/FuzzleOfficial"
