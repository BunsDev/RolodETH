  "description": "Foundation 1/1 Gallery\n\n\"Rach Stewart Visual Journey\" is a collection of 10 favourite moments I captured and then curated forever on the blockchain as 1/1 Photography NFT's\n\nWith a deep connection for nature, my photography journey started almost a decade ago. Since then I've been travelling New Zealand and many other countries with my camera in hand, capturing incredible scenes from the natural world with signature style long exposure imagery and dreamscapes."
