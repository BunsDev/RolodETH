  "description": "Citiesto is a Hevey's generative art project inspired by aerial views of cities with a high density of buildings. Its perspective effect, its perfectly imprecise lines, its subtle textures and its very advanced level of detail give it the appearance of a hand-drawn work.\n\nBehind the visible art (the image) hides another form of art, an extremely complex algorithm capable of calculating and drawing in 2D each variation of the Citiesto project. To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n"
