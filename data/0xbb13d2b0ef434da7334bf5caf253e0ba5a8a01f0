  "description": "My art has its own Universe. I draw many things and characters in a warm and juicy cartoon style. My artworks tell about girls, animals, aliens, vampires, crypto currency and even bad trip! Some of my artworks keep an important message and tell about some situations in the world or at the crypto market. I decided to unite all my bright illustrations in the one collection. And since they show my inner world, I called it “House of Tony”. This title is also related to my regular space on Twitter for artists and collectors. I have to say it’s my personal brand I’m building every day. Welcome to the wonderful world of my imagination!"
