  "description": "OGs are a limited edition PFP collection that blend the styles of JakNFT and Hiroji Kotegawa into an entirely new art form.\n\nOGs were created using a special process that combines glitch, animation, sculpting and 3D modeling.\n\nOnly 369 OGs exist. Each OG is unique, hand-crafted and was meticulously curated pre-mint. Every OG is essentially a 1/1 work of art.\n\nThe OGs are a degenerate crew of glitchy mfers who broke off from JakNFT’s HOODIE GANG and formed a rival crew on the Far East side of The Jakverse. OGs and Hoodies share the same roots, but are engaged in a brutal glitch war with no end in sight…\n\nCC0"
