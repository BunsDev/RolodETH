  "description": "The Rings is the first generative art project by Andrew Fernandez. Originally inspired by the rings on a tree stump, but the algorithm took on a life of its own. There will only ever be 1000 pieces of this project. Fully generated via on chain code. I don't know what the system will produce until it's minted.\n\nBest if viewed full width at the source url."
