  "description": "This collection marks the introduction of NFTs into the body of work of Carlos, in collaboration with animator IJ Cacnio, and minted through a grant from the First Mint Fund.\n\nThe NFTs sprung from a remark Carlos’ collectors have told him over the years: “I wish I could step into the world of the painting.” This has dictated the theme of Carlos' genesis collection, launched on the occasion of his 72nd birthday.\n\n2000px x 2000px.
