  "description": "An eightfold colour story collection created by Martin Houra, which captures an appreciation of controlled chaos. Drawing inspiration from liquid movement, like droplets running down a wall, unique paths and patterns of colour have been translated into 500 semi-generative artworks. Born through an algorithm, each piece has been hand selected, manipulated and overlaid with subtle motion to increase the inherent tension in the work, as they appear to simultaneously desire movement or change whilst remaining completely still. The majority of these captured moments are further confounded by a border that accentuates the image boundaries, where patterns seemingly attempt to break free of the imposed structure."
