  "description": "Often times, moments of solitude, togetherness, and disconnect occur without anyone knowing. It seems that our expressive nature gets lost when there's no reciprocation.\n\nEvery now and again, the emotion lost in the ecosystem of humanity comes forth and can be seen again.\n\nUnder a temporary guise, swiftly vanishing instants become tangible.\n\nNew York City, c. 2018-2021"
