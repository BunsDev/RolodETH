  "description": "It is a collection of 10,000 unique hand-drawn Chad NFTs by Degen artists.\n\nChad represents early adopters of DeFi and NFT spaces. Chad is obsessed with trading shitcoins and apeing into unaudited protocols.\nWhen your virgin friends buy Facebook or Apple stocks and wait for a decade to make 2x profit, you make 100x profit by buying DOGE coin with 50x leverage, yield farming vegetable tokens, and minting some fancy NFTs.\n\nIn some time, Chad NFT will be so rare. It will become history.\nStand out from virgins and be a Chad with your own NFT.\n\nJoin Chad's party to become a legend ü¶ç"
