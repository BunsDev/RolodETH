  "description": "Worldâ€™s Largest Peace Painting brought to life! \n2,000 double-sided fine art paintings assemble into a 17-story monolith to inspire a Vision of Unity and Peace. \nThe NFT Vision of Unity and Peace Collection comprises one-of-one digital versions of each side of 2,000 paintings, totaling 4,000 NFTs in its entirety.\n\"Vision of Unity\" is the front side comprising 2,000 pieces, representing all of us as a whole. Dual symbols of peace are formed, the white dove with its olive branch and the contemporary peace sign formed by 272 national flags. Within this framework we find 1,670 Visions: a community of global faces, revealing the entire spectrum of human emotion. The Mission paintings (14 pieces) convey ways we can collectively achieve the greater Vision. A solitary, surveying Eye and 3 colorful heart paintings beat at the core of the final image. \nEnvision a future where world peace is a reality.\n\nExclusive, artist-direct pricing available."
