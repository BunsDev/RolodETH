  "description": "Picture the New York Subway and the millions of personal interactions that unfold each day. Think of all the possible ways people show love to one another — while waiting for the train to arrive, sitting on the subway car, wide-eyed and people watching, or while holding hands, longing for that moment to last just a little longer.\n\nBeneath the streets of New York, you'll find the underground — a world in itself. It's a place where moments like these are created and experienced with each passing moment of the day. Here, there is an immense beauty overlooked amongst the chaos and grime. In my latest series, NYC Underground Stories, my purpose is to find, celebrate, and preserve these moments forever.\n\nWelcome to NYC Underground Stories."
