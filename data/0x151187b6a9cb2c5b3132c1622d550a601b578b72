  "description": "Welcome to my digital art gallery.\nI have been a professional photographer for many years. But my biggest passion is digital art. My composings consist of many different images that I put together into one. Although they are fantasy images, there is always a true story behind them. Maybe you can see right away what I want to say with the picture or you can let your imagination run wild. I hope you enjoy browsing and if you have a question about an image, I'll be happy to help."
