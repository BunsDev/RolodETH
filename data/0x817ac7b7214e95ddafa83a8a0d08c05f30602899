  "description": "Cats have been venerated by many different cultures for thousands of generations. A multitude of these cultures held beliefs that cats represented powerful omens that were to be taken very seriously. FYEO {For Your Eyes Only}  is a carefully crafted collection of felines paying homage to the history of this revered animal. We hope that these will bring blessings and good vibes to all who hold them."
