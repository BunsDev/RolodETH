  "description": "Itâ€™s 2022 and there are still millions of fish living in the sea. Letâ€™s take a closer look. The little clownfish â€“ letâ€™s call him Larry â€“ has just hatched. He doesnâ€™t know that years ago he could have had millions of siblings; today he only has his brother Barry. Heâ€™s totally excited to discover his home, the beautiful reef. After a short swim, however, he realises that half the reef is dead. Horrified, he returns to the anemone to tell his brother about it â€“ but Barry is already floating at the surface, bottom up, wrapped in a plastic bag. This is just one sad story among thousands every day. Letâ€™s get engaged in helping marine life recover. \n\nKeep your virtual sealife in the fish-tank. ðŸ’« 25% Donation to Save the Ocean Charitys.\n\nâ€¢ The GENESIS FISH is a fine art, hand drawn, computer generated collectible of 1'111 diverse fish designed by Gregory Hedrich & Muffeundpranke. \nâ€¢ Each GENESIS FISH produce 10 PEARL$ per day!\n\nhttps://fish-tank.io/ \n\n\n"
