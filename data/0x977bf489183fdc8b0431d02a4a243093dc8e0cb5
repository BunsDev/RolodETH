  "description": "As long as I can remember I have always loved mountains. Whether it's playing among them or admiring them from afar, I've never seen a mountain I didn't find magical. I want to bring my admiration for mountains to you in the way I experienced them that day. As if you were there.\n\nThis collection has formed over the last 5 years and will continue to grow until it has 100 pieces.\n\nA percentage of sales will be used to fund my Outdoor Initiative, a project motivating others to get outside."
