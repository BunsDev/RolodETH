  "description": "The Jolly Elves have courageously volunteered to complete a perilous mission for their benefactor Santa. \n 6000 Elves were handpicked to venture into the digital metaverse to discover new\nmethods and techniques to get gifts to everyone throughout the year. This mission was titled, Operation Jolly.\nThe Metaverse is vast, and the Elves have gotten themselves stuck throughout the various ecosystems. Some of\nwhich have changed them irrevocably.. \nAs they look for a way to report back to Santa's Workshop, who knows what they will find."
