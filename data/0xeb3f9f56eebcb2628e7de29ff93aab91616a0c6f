  "description": "The \"Surreal Life\" is a collection of 251 completely generative still life works. Each painting is unique and generated from artificial intelligence using a deep learning architecture called diffusion modeling. \n\nThe classical shapes, patterns, and colors of traditional still life are captured from millions of images and then transformed into the synthetic fruits, flowers, and vases seen in each composition.\n"
