I've often wondered where a machine's mind and \"hand\" would wander given the same opportunity.\n\nThis project explores the age-old computer art phenomenon of inviting the viewer to actively participate in the interpretation of the visual output. The way \"Sharp-E\" draws the strokes is through a mix of various movements — irregular curves, straight lines, sudden changes in direction — in a classic random walk algorithm, while avoiding overlaps with previously drawn strokes. There are no pre-programmed forms per se, but nevertheless it can be common for the viewer to perceive images, symbols, meaning in the generated output.\n\nSo where does your mind wander? What forms, symbols, and meaning do you see?\n\nControls:\n• 'D' toggles pausing/drawing or continues space-filling after the first stop (if available)\n• 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n• 'S' saves the output"
