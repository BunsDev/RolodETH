  "description": "It's up to you, now.  The Waifu Warriors have been torn from the far corners of the multiverse. Only 2,822 Waifu Warriors remain in the Training Arena after the first Trial of the Flame. Factions come together as the twelve armies form to stand against the greatest threat in the Metaverse. The adventure begins in The Sandbox Game in late 2022. A comic book, an animation, and a video game are currently in development. Select your Waifu Warrior and Prepare for Battle!\n\nOwners of each of these ERC-721 tokens are granted the commercial use of IP license rights, under the condition that the token is yours & the content is not gratuitous or pornographic.
