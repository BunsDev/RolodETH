  "description": "Adventures is an anthology of cinematic scenes. An art collection featuring NFT characters and stories born from the imagination of their collectors. Think animated comic strip meets operatic cinema!\n\nYou as the collector will collaborate with me & the Atrium Story Core to tell the unfolding saga you imagine. Together we will build the story of your hero step by step, and introduce a foundation you can build from in the future. Whether you are looking to create a single animation or string together many to discover new lands, rare treasures, epic fights, and tales of love for your character, it's up to you. You decide their fate.\n\nThese collaborations between collector and artist aim to celebrate what’s possible with ownership throughout Web3, and empower collectors to be creative partners. My transition into the digital art space has just begun and I can’t wait to leverage my experience to combine art, storytelling, and technology with my collectors."
