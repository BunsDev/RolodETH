  "description": "“Pandora’s Box” is a collection of thirteen 1/1 photographs from Greece.\n\nThere is nothing more enticing than the unknown, and like Pandora, I will always embrace my irresistible curiosity of the unknown. With this collection I want to share a part of my journey. Travelling and wanting to see the world has always been a part of who I am. When I am out there travelling and taking photographs, it gives me hope and purpose – I am truly alive.\n\nEach photograph is titled with a beautiful Greek word, part of a language that has bound humans together for thousands of years. My hope is that these words will resonate with you in the same way that they resonated with me.\n\nWill you be a part of my journey?\n\n(created on my own ERC-721 smart contract using manifold)"
