  "description": "Devious Demon Dudes is a collection of 6666 unique Demon NFTs. They live eternally attached to the ethereum blockchain. Each demon and demon trait was digitally hand drawn to achieve devious perfection.  DDD is a community run project where members decide where funds will be allocated, what rewards to be given, and what events to occur around and beyond the metaverse. Ownership of a demon gives continuous reward and access to the 666 club. See our roadmap and other perks at our website, https://deviousdemondudes.com/ regularly for more details and updates."
