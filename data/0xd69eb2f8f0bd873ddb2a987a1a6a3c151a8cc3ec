  "description": "8 Bit Graffiti Mansion is a highly rare collection of 420 Mini 8 Bit Graffiti Mansion Art living on the Ethereum blockchain. Based around the infamous \"Graffiti Mansion\" in Las Vegas. Each of these Tokens is your invitation to a future event at the mansion. Which event you say? Well, you'll just have to wait and see. But one thing is certain. First we paint, then we party, then we party, then we paint. (Must be 18 or older and we reserve the right to not fuck with you and or let you come to a party...) - all royalties will be used for booze and spray paint n dumb shit ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
