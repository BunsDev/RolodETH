  "description": "DumpsterDorks is an NFT collection of 5,000 randomly generated avatars stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). Spawned from over 700 of the sickest hand-drawn elements this side of the intergalactic dump, each Dork is amassed from curiosities like lost limbs, busted appliances, and hazardous waste, along with special (and scarce!) surprises. Dive into the dumpster and score some trash worth treasuring!\n\n[DumpsterDorks Series 2](https://opensea.io/collection/dumpsterdorks-s2)\n\n[DumpsterDorks Collabs](https://opensea.io/collection/dumpster-dorks-collabs)\n\n[DumpsterDorks Slimeballs](https://opensea.io/collection/ddslimeballs)\n\n[DumpsterDorks Website](https://www.dumpsterdorks.com/)\n\n[DumpsterDorks Discord](https://discord.com/invite/zAstZNb5Ab)"
