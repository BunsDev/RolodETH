  "description": "As the hands of time have moved consistently throughout history, they touch different parts of our past as well as parts of our future. The meter in the foreground reminds us we only only have this one lifetime, and it’s what we do with our minutes and seconds that really count. The blue side and the red side symbolize two different paths on which time eventually fades, and a purple rose reminds us that regardless of progress or destination we must appreciate the journey along the way. \n\nOne constant has always been the divide between generations and races, which anchors the center of the clock. The milky way is found in the third eye because our potential is limitless when we can break free from the patterns that have held us back historically. The universe becomes the surface on which one struggles to slow down the hours because the minutes are flying away. In the end our lives will be stacks of months and years and decades. It’s what we did in between the pages in the seconds "
