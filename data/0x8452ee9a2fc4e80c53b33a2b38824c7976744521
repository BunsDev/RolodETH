  "description": "Sky Meadow is an on-chain generative art piece built using Javascript. Each piece is unique and uses it's own individual seed value.\nPlanes and vectors are intertwined into elaborate knotwork patterns that are reminiscent of a land once filled with endless forests, rivers, and wildlife. Named after a place of lush beauty nested deep in the heart of Virginia.\nThere are 24 different possible colorways and three possible dimensions."
