  "description": "Check the full collection on [sabotage.kim](https://sabotage.kim). \r\nSabotage pictures the constant fight of order versus chaos. It takes shape of a series of real time animations that move pixels in a simple but oddly surprising way. Central to the animation are various sets of patterns such as grids, lines and gradients that are arranged on the canvas to create an initial state of order. The rows start to shift to the left and right and in the middle of the canvas, the 'saboteur' is shifting pixels from the top to the bottom to manipulate the order of the patterns. The process runs endlessly and mixes pixels into new compositions while also restructuring the order on its edges."
