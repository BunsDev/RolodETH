  "description": "EpoHeroes are dynamic, user-generated virtual identities created using our text-to-hero generator that are game-ready for metaverse games. EpoHeroes owners can animate their virtual identities using text or voice â€” making the EpoHeroes speak their messages.\n\nEpoHeroes stretch the limits of pfp projects by using AI to extend virtual identities and give them new power & utility that will be useful in many different contexts."
