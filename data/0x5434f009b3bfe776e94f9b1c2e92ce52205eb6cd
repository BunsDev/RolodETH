  "description": "Reloacted to: https://opensea.io/collection/cancerous-cows\n\nThe cows have won! The COWMOONITY is now holding the project! New management has been assembled. Using funds generated from the royalties, the following NFT will be used to grant a free NFT mint to all holders of CowCowMoo. 1 NFT = 1 NFT, 5 NFTs = 5 NFTs, etc. The COWMOONITY is strong on this farm and it's time to make CowCowMoo again!\n\nBackground:\nThe reveal had been promised but was a lie, and the project founder went silent for a full 24 hours. The whole community had fallen victim to a rug pull. Not that surprising honestly, but this is where things turn around.\n\nThe cows went to work in the Discord, wallets were tracked, and the community has identified the rugpullers.( More on this soon ;) ) The founder didnâ€™t like this and started to panic. He got angry. He spoke in a very different tone after he was identified. We demanded the contract for the project and it was transferred to TheDeepFunds.\n"
