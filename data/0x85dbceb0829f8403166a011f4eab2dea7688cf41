  "description": "Early in his career, powered by his sharp wit and tireless work ethic, @Lushsux became Australia's most famous street artist. Creating sell out collections for Banksy's Walled Off Hotel, headlining major street art-festivals and being the only Australian artist invited to collaborate in Banksy's Dismaland. It became apparent that he had achieved everything that he could in the world of street art. Realizing that it was time to move on, @Lushsux invented his own category of art. @Lushsux became the world's first meme artist, subsequently founding the meme art movement. Representing a phenomenon which has since become a foundation of modern communication, social movements and media."
