  "description": "DICPIC NFT IS NOT JUST A COLLECTION OF JPEGS, BUT A COMMUNITY OF DICS WORLDWIDE, WITH ONE PRIMARY GOAL OF TROLLING THE METAVERSE.\n\nWE MAY BE LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS; SOME MAY CALL US UNSOLICITED OR UNWANTED. BUT NEITHER WAS VAN GOGH  VALUED IN HIS TIME, YET NOW HIS WORK IS CALLED PRICELESS. WE DON'T CARE WHAT SOCIETY WANTS; WE ARE THE HERO THE COMMUNITY NEEDS.\n\nNO ROADMAP - NO UTILITY - NOT A DAO, WE ARE A DIC-TATORSHIP - ONE OF US! ONE OF US! ONE OF US!"
