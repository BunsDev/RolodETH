  "description": "Moon Owls is artistic pieces that expresses an idea, an emotion or, more generally, a world view. Focusing on reflecting social substrates in its design. Moon Owls is meant to stimulate thought and conversation between the eyes of the beholder. By reflecting the piece of art, we dive into our own experiences and nostalgia - a piece of art can be understood in different ways to every person.\n\nThe idea of Moon Owls is to have a PFP collection of all 1/1 legendaries that are of limited supply. Meant for the expression of human creative skill and imagination, in a visual form presented to be appreciated in a canvas for empowerment of beauty and emotional power. "
