  "description": "The Fat Academy is a place where Apes and NFT enthusiasts can learn to become true (or almost true) SuperHeroes.\nIn this Genesis collection, meet 200 of the Super Fat Apes, designed by Carlos Dattoli, 3D artist (worked for Marvel and DC) and brought to life by Marc AureÃÅlien, viral video maker (+1M followers on instagram).\nThey are not smarter than others, nor less greedy, but they have been part of the Fat Academy longer than some hundred-year-old trees. Which is not an understatement."
