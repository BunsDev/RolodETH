  "description": "Interactive, software-based art and one of the very first NFT collections to deviate from simple image and video formats.\n\nPROOF OF {ART}WORK pieces are mathematical entities resulting from a simple equation: z_n -> {z_n}^2 + z_0\n\nThese NFTs aren't images, but explorable galaxies of millions of points plotted onto 2D space. PO{A}W uses bespoke software to explore these on-demand, inspired by the logic underpinning Google Maps.\n\nPO{A}W is an early example of an on-chain NFT collection, with token IDs representing unique z_0 values for the equation above. As aesthetically pleasing IDs are rare and must be found at random, their discovery can be considered akin to blockchain miningâ€”with a reward of an artistic proof.\n\n[OpenSea Artist Interview](https://bit.ly/3gLczwO) | [Artist's notes](https://proofofwork.art) | [The Buddhabrot](https://bit.ly/3JqIoHK)"
