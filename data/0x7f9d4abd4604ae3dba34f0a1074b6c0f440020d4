  "description": "Los Samos are revolutionaries. They fight for freedom of speech, of art, of finance, of economy. \nThey are colorful spirits that blur the line between avatars and stand-alone art. They are named after SAMO, that Jean-Michel Basquiat used to write on walls before he started painting. Same Old Shit. As crypto artists and DeFi believers, we won't accept it. It is time for a change. Are you going to be a revolutionary ?\nGrab one of these beautiful 1:1 work of arts and join our discord to see the biggest roadmap you have ever seen in a project. Much love"
