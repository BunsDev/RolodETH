  "description": "The Slothverse Genesis Collection, 28 piece one of ones, pays homage to iconic characters that have inspired our sloths.\n\nThere are 3 origins to Slothverse Genesis. The Eastern and Western Origins reflect the diverse origins of Slothverse founding team. The Insanity Origin highlights major character complexes and mental health issues that illustrate the crazy modern world we all live in.\n\nGenesis Sloths will be auctioned off in the month of February, and the owners of Genesis Sloths will be airdropped a Sloth NFT from our upcoming Slothverse main collection with a Treehouse NFT. Genesis Sloths are separate from our 8,888 sloths from the main collection, but they will play a special role in the upcoming Slothverse."
