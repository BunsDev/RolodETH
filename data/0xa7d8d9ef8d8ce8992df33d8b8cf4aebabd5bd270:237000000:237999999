  "description": "Inspired by the bright lights of the big city, Time Squared is an homage to New York City, brought to life through the magic of prime numbers. \n\nA key problem that we wanted to solve with this project is allowing visually impaired individuals to enjoy our art. As a result, these artworks feature a first-of-its-kind screen reader which contains a detailed description of the colors, movement, size, and structure of the artwork. You can activate it by enabling a screen reader such as ChromeVox and hovering over the artwork. \n\nUse any key to pause the artwork, or click to make it full screen. Photosensitive warning: These artworks contain flashing colors and moving patterns that could trigger seizures for people with visual sensitivities."
