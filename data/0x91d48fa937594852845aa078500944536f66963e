  "description": "The collection by DOUBLE TOP and free Ukrainian crypto community. Designed by sibileva.eth.\n\nOur NFT collection is not about war. It is about Ukrainian women who protect our families and show us love. We live and fight for this love.  This NFT collection consists of 2402 elements. The war in Ukraine started on 24.02.2022. The price of each NFT is 0,05 ETH. It includes 2,5% royalty which will be transferred to donations.\n\nAll money received from the sale of NFTs will be immediately directed to help the Ukrainian army and civilians in harm's way. We also will be constantly reporting our donations."
