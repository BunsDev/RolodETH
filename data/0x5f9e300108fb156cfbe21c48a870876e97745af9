  "description": "Uncool Cats is a collection of 6969 cats living on the Ethereum blockchain. These cats have been through the wringer - stuffed in lockers, do the cool cats' homework, lack a skincare routine and otherwise are down on their luck! Don't pet these cats, they haven't showered in weeks!\r\n\r\nThe pathetic counterparts you've never heard of! \r\nIn an unjust world, we can't all be cool, right? \r\n\r\n[www.uncoolcats.com](https://uncoolcats.com)\r\n\r\nNot affiliated with Cool Cats."
