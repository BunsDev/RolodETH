  "description": "*Controlled randomness can be a tool to produce beautiful aesthetic variation; or for subversively rigging a game or economic system.*\n[https://degen.deafbeef.com](https://degen.deafbeef.com)\n\nAn NFT collection of generative art slot machines. Owners compete to be first to win jackpots, granting mint passes for a diminishing supply of additional slot machine NFTs with increasingly rare attributes. \n\nA reflection on several themes in the mashup of generative art and (crypto)economic systems: controlled random processes, distribution of value, real and artificial scarceness, competition, gamification, merit, risk and precarity."
