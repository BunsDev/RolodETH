  "description": "This collection is driven and defined by happy coincidence, awkward social interaction, and straight-up absurdity. It was created by strolling the beach and summoning the courage to approach total strangers and asking them to willingly create weird art with us. This collection addresses many questions that touch on the core of human interaction- Why are we so uncomfortable approaching strangers in the first place? What is motivating them to say yes? Under what circumstances are they saying no?"
