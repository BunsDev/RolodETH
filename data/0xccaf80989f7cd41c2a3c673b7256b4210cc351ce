  "description": "Telling people where to go is just the beginning. Welcome to Afterlife, a world-building simulation that lets you create the hereafter in the here and now. Possessed of an unearthly sense of humor, it all begins in a god-knows-where galaxy. As a \"regional spiritual director\" your task, given to you by the Powers That Be, is to develop two prime planes of “unreal estate” - heaven and hell - simultaneously. Keep the billions of souls happy by giving them the rewards and punishments they deserve.\n\n555 supply|0.001 each|[Mint](https://afterlife-simulator.netlify.app)"
