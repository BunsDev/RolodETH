  "description": "In a secluded laboratory in the far north, a young Warlock works tirelessly on finally creating a living being, a Golem. He gestures wildy in thin air as streaks of clay follow his movements. Slowly the streaks start taking a human form. Once finished, the Warlock breathes life into the inanimate sculpture.\n\nEvery day, the Warlock inches closer to his goal as the Golems become increasingly humanlike."
