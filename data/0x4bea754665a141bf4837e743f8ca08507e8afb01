  "description": "The RabbiTus Project is a series of artworks making social commentaries. This project aims to be more than just profile pictures, serving as a creative means to express values of RabbiTus holders. Just like the white rabbit that led Alice to the rabbit hole and Wonderland, RabbiTus will lead the holders to a wondrous and safe place where any conversation is possible over a cup of tea. The holders, by participating in these conversations, will further fuel our creations, adding new identities of RabbiTus."
