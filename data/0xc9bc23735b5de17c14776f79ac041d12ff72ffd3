  "description": "Van Minion is a collection of 51 NFT's, the genesis collection from Christian Rex Van Minnen. 10 NFTs will be available per drop over the course of late 2021/Early 2022.  Each work in the collection of 51 is an animated 1/1, and during each drop 2,000 ‘blanks’ will be available for minting. What makes van Minions unique is the boundaries between creators and community will become blurred; between patron and artist, physical and digital, studio and metaverse, individual and collective . Old systems of patronage and the the ‘old masters’ painters workshop (i.e. Rubens and Rembrandt) will be adapted to a digital, decentralized landscape and marketplace, calling into question the history of art through patronage and what is possible moving forward."
