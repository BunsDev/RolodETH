  "description": "2012 Cannes Film Festival – For the first time in the festival’s history, a father and son, my father and brother, had films in competition the same year. The New York Times hired me to shoot a daily diary of the goings on at the festival between the two films, and I was given unprecedented access to places photographers aren’t usually allowed to go.\n\nUn Certain Regard means \"a certain glance\" and is a section of the festival for films with unusual, non-traditional stories."
