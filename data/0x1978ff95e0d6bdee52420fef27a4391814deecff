(These are all pixel art drawn on a 32x32 canvas.)\nThis collection is limited to 1,000 pieces.\n\nDrools always have a calm idea.\nAnd they never contend with other ideas.\nThis is a necessary thought for decentralization.\nIn other words, having this NFT is identity, fashion, and peace.\nDrools always tells us “Everything will be fine!”."
