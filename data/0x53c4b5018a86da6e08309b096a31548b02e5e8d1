  "description": "„Unspoiled Blues“ is about the unspoiled places that call to mind feelings of serenity. \n\nThis collection of fifty 1/1 artworks created over the last 6 years shows my journey as a photographer and is the result of thousands of hours spent in nature, searching for the perfect image. The task that kept me sane in the hardest times of my life. \n\nFor me blue is not only a color. It’s a generic term for all the places where I feel inner peace. Capturing the worlds most beautiful blues is a photographic challenge, that I dedicated my entire photography career to."
