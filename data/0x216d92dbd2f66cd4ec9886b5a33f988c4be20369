  "description": "This is an alternate collection of Flickys that were minted on the **OLD** smart contract. **FG DO NOT BUY.** This alternate collection will act as tokens with their own utility down the road.\nPurchasing from this collection will **NOT** result in a Flicky. Everyone who minted Flickys on 06/15 have received their Flickys on the **NEW** contract via airdrop."
