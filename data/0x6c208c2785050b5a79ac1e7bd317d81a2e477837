  "description": "Bodega Blocks is a utility-driven urban art NFT project with innovative mechanics, collaborations with 1/1 web3 artists and art-focused NFT projects.   \n\nJust as your nearby bodega that is the cornerstone of your community that connects all of your unique neighbors, BodegaBlocks is that inflection point that connects  1/1 art with the generative space, defi nerds with NFT apes and utility bros with strong a art centric aesthetic.\n\nThe Bodegas are generatively produced isometric buildings at 4000x4000pixels that represent owner occupied businesses around the world. \n\nThis first collection involves multiple mint tiers, each rewarding in its own right and with special attributes.\n\nThe first 111 NFTs are the Preferred Genesis mint and the only part of the collection that features the Bling Bodegas.
