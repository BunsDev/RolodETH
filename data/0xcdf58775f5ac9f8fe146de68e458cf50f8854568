  "description": "\nWACK! is a fine art collectible by the artist Camille Chiang. Capped at 200 items, this collection is a vibrant expression of the raw colorfulness of creation. \n\nThe name is a nod to Camille’s childhood in Hong Kong, when she often used the term to describe all things fun and unique. Moving abroad, she later learned how the word took on a contrary meaning. Now, ‘wack’ is a playful symbol of difference. \n\nEach purchase of a WACK! collectible represents a subscription to Camille’s art, granting exclusive access to future drops, merch, and much more."
