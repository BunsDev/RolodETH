  "description": "Manifest is a collective of creators, visionaries, and builders who want more out of life. We believe that you can create your own reality, and the way that you show up in the world is important. Previously, this was determined by your location, your physical appearance, your family, your class, all these concepts that we at birth do not choose. But, what if you could be whoever you wanted to be? This is what the Metaverse allows, you are no longer limited to being judged by anything physical. You are judged by your messages, the quality of your ideas, your profile pictures, your on-chain history, and your work. \n\nThis does not mean physical reality is irrelevant, it’s still there. It’s balanced, one foot in and one foot out. We believe if you wear our collective clothing, contribute to the collective, connect dots with others, and find common ground. By helping each other achieve each other's dreams, you will manifest your own in the process. \n"
