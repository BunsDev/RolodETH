  "description": "**We just migrated to Ethereum! ðŸŽ‰**  On October 30th, 2022, we migrated the Courtyard collection from Polygon to Ethereum. Our [old collection](https://opensea.io/collection/courtyard-nft-legacy) is still visible on OpenSea, but the NFTs there cannot be traded anymore.\n\n**Courtyard** unlocks a better way to collect and trade physical assets as **[Connected Collectibles](https://courtyard.io)**. Visit **[courtyard.io](https://courtyard.io)** to learn more."
