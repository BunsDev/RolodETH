You can choose to reroll its visuals/stats anytime at the cost of your CryptoEddie taking -1 HP damage. Your CryptoEddie will also take -1 HP damage when it's transferred or sold (due to mishandled shipping & handling)! Wonder what happens when your CryptoEddie reaches 0 HP... ðŸ¤”\n\nCreated by [@eddietree](https://twitter.com/eddietree)"
