  "description": "Cryptographics is a fully decentralized digital art creation platform that allows users to create, store and trade unique randomly generated digital artwork on the blockchain. It is a place where Artists, Creators and Collectors come together to create graphical assets, generate cryptographics and collect or trade them.\r\n\r\nArtists are visual artists, illustrators, photographers or graphic designers, who create graphical assets and upload them as Asset packs that can then be used to generate cryptographics.\r\n\r\nCreators are authors of cryptographics and they select, buy and use Asset packs to generate unique randomly generated digital artwork (cryptographics) and claim ownership by storing them on the blockchain as unique ERC-721 tokens in order to keep or sell them.\r\n\r\nCollectors can purchase and collect cryptographics, either to create a unique collection of their own, or to trade them as unique digital collectibles on the Gallery marketplace."
