  "description": "SquishiLand plots are the genesis land plots which will be utilised in the [Squishiverse's](https://www.squishiverse.com) interoperable metaverse. This collection will have an extremely high amount of utility and value within the Squishiverse ecosystem - including passive yield of $xSLIME and through staking, ability to charge rent and sell items, ability to create future land plots, etc. \n\nThe Squishiverse will be a limited map, and these genesis plots will be physical, external plots within our districts.\n\nThe NFT space sees land differently than we do. We see land as a form of real estate inside our network/ecosystem. We decoupled this functionality so that we could add a variety of use cases to these land plots in the future.\n\n[Website](https://www.squishiverse.com) | [Discord](https://www.discord.gg/squishiverse) | [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/squishiversenft) | [Squishiverse Items](https://opensea.io/collection/squishiverse-items)"
