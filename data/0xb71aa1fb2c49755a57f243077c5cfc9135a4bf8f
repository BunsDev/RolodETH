  "description": "CURRENTLY MINTING. - https://hybridhumansnft.xyz/\n\nWe are building the largest Network of public pay2play Ecosystems in the Web3 space.\n\nAt its core, the HyHu Network consists of multiple Ecosystems tied back to an amazing NFT at the centre, powered by a $HyHu token.\n\nAll Ecosystems will be independently revenue generating and can be used by both Public and Holders. \n\nThe $HyHu token will be off-chain and will be used throughout all of the Network. \n\nThe Public can purchase these tokens and the Holders will accrue them.  The HyHu NFT collection will be at the heart of the entire Network. All Ecosystems will generate profits and will fund Holders benefits through amazing and innovative utilities. \n\n10 have been planned for the launch of Ecosystem 1, with more being added as the Network expands."
