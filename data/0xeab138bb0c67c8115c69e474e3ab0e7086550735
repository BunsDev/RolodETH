  "description": "The \"Dad Pass\" serves as your access to all future airdrops from sneakerdad. A homage to Jake the Degen - I want people to join me on my journey as I grow as a photographer. \n\nHolding this token allows you access to at least 1 airdrop per month (from myself/curated artists) and all future projects from sneakerdad."
