  "description": "Chalklines is the second collection of the 'By Accident' archive.\nPhotographs shot by my grandfather working as a collision investigator in the 60ies and 70ies.\n\nChalk was used to visualize the trajectory of the vehicles involved.\nIn these photographs it often creates a focus point where otherwise there would be none.\n\nSometimes the chalk almost seems burnt into the image.\n\nPure white in sharp contrast to the brutality of a car crash."
