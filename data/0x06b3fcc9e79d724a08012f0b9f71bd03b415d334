  "description": "Never Fear Truth is the genesis collection of 3,850 NFTs created by Johnny Depp.\n\nEach NFT acts 1) as a membership key to his community and future releases, establishing a creative community of fans and friends through ownership on the Ethereum blockchain, 2) is backed by a single claimable physical edition. Head to the website to find out more and check whether a NFT's physical print has been claimed.\n\nFor him there has always been art. Before acting, and before music, art has always been an important outlet for his creativity. In this first public exposure of Johnny's art he has focussed on 'Friends and Heroes'. People he has known well, and who have inspired him as a person. Each image is an intimate reflection of their character in Johnny's eyes; a portrayal of how they have revealed themselves to him.\n\nPortraits of friends, heroes and family; created by Johnny and animated to create truly unique works of generative art."
