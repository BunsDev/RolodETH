  "description": "The year is 2021. A paradigm shift has occurred at this exact point in space and time. ✖ marks that point. \n\nThe series is an ode to this revolutionary movement of NFTs and a tribute to the pioneers, the innovators, the visionaries, and the believers. \n\nAkin to historical monuments, each ✖ is forged onto the blockchain, forever to serve as a testimony of this moment in space and time. Digital monoliths echoing the vibration of an era.\n\n✖s are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS.\n\n\nMy other collections:\n\n[What Makes an Artist](https://opensea.io/collection/whatmakesanartist)\n\n[yonvisuals playground](https://opensea.io/collection/yonvisualsplayground)"
