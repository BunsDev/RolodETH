  "description": "Moses’ Tunnel Series stem from the human mind’s natural impulse to imagine new, possible worlds.\n\nThe artist’s starting point is light: when set into certain patterns and angles, the eye perceives it as distances that can lead into thresholds, where time and space doesn't exist, and where contours are absorbed with such an astounding force that their reality gets twisted.\n\nThese artworks provide a personal, intimate escape. They free the viewer from the weights of everyday burdens, led by the artist through a door into the extraordinary, into the unknown.\n\n\nControls\nL or U to lock or unlock steering\nSpace bar to pause \nUp or down arrow to resume motion"
