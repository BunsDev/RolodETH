  "description": "These utility cards will affect how your Hillbilly performs the jobs from the job board as well as earn you a bit of extra Hollers while doing so. These cards will show up again in the future when we release our trading card expansion but for now we've created a GENESIS set of \"Settler's Mint\" cards with an alternate golden art. \n\nThere will only be 300 of these created, we will drop 100 at a time on days leading up to the mint of Hillbilly Holler. \n"
