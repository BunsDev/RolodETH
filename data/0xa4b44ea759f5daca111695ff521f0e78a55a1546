  "description": "Foundation collection URL: https://foundation.app/collection/100nudeshoots\n\n100 NUDE Shoots (of Hugo) is a photographic project, started 2015, where I'm collaborating over my lifespan with 100 different photographers in the creation of 100 different nude photoshoots, each with its own unique concept, view and interpretation of how can the nude compose and mean in imagemaking.\n\nI started this project not as a solo photographer but as the performer-model in collaboration with other artists, in order to \"unite\" so many different contemporary views and concepts about nudity and, perhaps, help blur the lines that still distinguish, when the human body is portrayed, fine art from amateur, fashion from erotic, artistic from pornographic. In this process I mean to convey that being nude is being human, and the actions and the art we make with it should not need excuses or be subject to censorship.\n\n1 iconic photograph will be minted from each new collab, at a slowing pace, until I'm 100."
