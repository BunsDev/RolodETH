  "description": "Introducing the Budverse Legends: Dwyane Wade x Budweiser Zero Edition. This first-ever, open edition NFT project with Dwyane Wade showcases words of wisdom from the legend himself, inspiring you to make positive changes happen in both your life and community. Budweiser and Dwyane Wade are committed to leveraging their unique capabilities, relationships and reach to make a positive impact in the community.\r\n\r\nTogether, Budweiser and Wade have teamed up to make a donation to create a grant program for minority-owned businesses in underserved communities across the US. The grant program builds on Wadeâ€™s efforts to empower communities of color through his work with Social Change Fund United. Plus, depending on which tier you mint, you could get our Core artwork, our D. Wade Decentraland Hoodie, the ultimate D. Wade starter kit, and the chance to win tickets to an IRL basketball game with D. Wade himself.\r\n\r\nYou must be 21+ (or legal drinking age) NFT holders. Terms and Conditions apply."
