  "description": "**MRAMMOU** is a utility token by grelysian. MRAMMOU are traditionally hand-drawn NFTs in the form of animals, objects, & humans that are my interpretations of Akan Gold weights.  \r\n  \r\nThe utility of the project is greatly influenced by the *weight* value of each token, listed in grams. Holding a combined weight per collector (wallets are vetted manually) qualifies the collector for air drops. Please visit https://grelysian.xyz/work/mrammou for a complete list.  \r\n  \r\nThe collection was originally minted on the OpenSea store front contract in July 2021. The collection has migrated to its own custom contract, via manifold.xyz, in February 2022.
