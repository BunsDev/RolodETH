  "description": "While getting lost in my hometown, I stumbled upon these children playing baseball. I watched them practice and hung out with the team for a little while. Baseball is a huge thing in my culture and many young men have found success as professional athletes making it in the big leagues. I want my accomplishments to be an example to others of a different career path that they might not have known was available as I have the great fortune to express myself and amplify my culture through photography. This is my Home Team. This is what I will forever play for.\n\nCome join my team.\n\n"
