  "description": "The Skytellers, an ancient warrior tribe once reigned supreme and united over the entire Universe. The protectors of all galaxies, their mission was to safeguard The Spark, a powerful energy source believed to provide life to all the galaxies within the Universe, including Metaverse 7.\n\nIn recent times, from the dark corners of the Universe, shadow forces have emerged seeking to seize The Spark’s energy for themselves. These forces have grown stronger and stronger, even turning the once pure Skytellers into shadow warriors.\n\n​Now, locked in the ultimate battle of light vs. dark, each side is trying to claim mastery over the entire universe with Skytellers fractured across both sides."
