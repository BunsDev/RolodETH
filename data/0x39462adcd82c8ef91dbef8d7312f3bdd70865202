  "description": "Hootbirds is evolved from INKE’s most important IP-Xiao Ying, and as the mascot of INKE from its inception to the present, it has been accompanied by INKE’s social products in front of every user and been loved by many users. This time, on the occasion of the official renaming of INKE to Inkeverse, Xiao Ying also bore the brunt of the layout of INKE web 3.0, the first commemorative avatar NFTs totaling 1,111 issued to INKEPASS holders in the form of airdrop. We hope you can take the Xiao Ying, also known as Hootbirds, and continue to roam in the Inkeverse we will build in the future."
