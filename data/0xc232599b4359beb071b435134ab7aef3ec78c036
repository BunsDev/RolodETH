  "description": "【 𝑚𝑖𝑑𝑛𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑖𝑠 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑔  】\n\nIKANI: ILLUMINATIONS is the first in a series of banner image NFT drops celebrating nature through the lens of AI-generated poetry and visuals. Each token represents an original and unique piece of art, generated on the fly by an individual collaborating with IKANI.\n\nHolding a poem pass NFT allows access to the IKANI.AI app, where the pass may be redeemed to generate a unique, AI-generated haiku banner NFT. Metadata traits on a poem pass are conferred to the created poem NFT, and affect the output of the text and image generation."
