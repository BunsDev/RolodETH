  "description": "\"This T-Shirt is Probably Nothing. It's not like it's going to burn later to be a skeleton key that opens secrets throughout the Evilverseâ„¢. I mean it'd be crazy for that to be their first mint. Right? Seriously though, I'm asking for a fren.\"\n\nThis NFT-Shirt will be redeemable on our website www.Evilverse.com in the near future for an In Real Life (IRL) version of it as well as a Decentraland version. Cult Life! ðŸ‘ŠðŸ¦ŽðŸ¦Ž "
