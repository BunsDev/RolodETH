  "description": "Particles are digital Collector Cards representing ownership in physical fine art masterpieces. They are your ticket to making decisions about what happens to the Art. Collect more Particles to have greater control over the art.\n\nBanksy's Love is in the Air is the genesis masterpiece of the Particle Collection. It epitomizes the unparalleled creative insurgency of Banksy’s oeuvre. Characterised by its recognisable subject, graphic force and visual directness, this iconic work has helped cement Banksy’s place as an a decisive political gadfly for our time.\n\nParticle acquired the piece at auction from Sotheby's on 5/13/2021 and the work was subsequently donated to the non-profit Particle Foundation where the piece will remain in perpetuity.\n\nLearn more on:\nhttps://www.particlecollection.com\nhttps://www.particledao.xyz"
