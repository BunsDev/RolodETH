  "description": "The Artist\n[Luke](https://twitter.com/madmandos) \n\n5555 TATERs from Tater Town Living on the Ethereum BlockChain. -\nAfter being fed up with only being known for potato chips and French fries, the Taters knew that there was something more to life. They saw an opportunity to not only improve themselves but the lives of others by venturing in to this new found space called Web3. From there it was decided that these lovable potatoes would establish a place that we like to call Tater Town."
