  "description": "After Land DAO’s success launching James Peter Henry’s first NFT collection, Cartels (sold out in 20 minutes), we are collaborating once again to expand James’ twisted and unique universe. Step into the Devour series. We teamed up with eBay to bring a novel art showcase at Art Basel 2021, where 4 Devour artworks were broken down into 600 NFT 'shards'. Collect 5 shards from one artwork and burn them to receive a complete artwork as NFT!\n\nMint: https://devour.landdao.io/\n\nArticle about launch: https://bit.ly/devour-article\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/land_dao\n\nDiscord:  http://discord.gg/landdao"
