  "description": "Mecha Chaotic is an experiment in decentralized game theory and emergent phenomena.\n\nYour journey into the Mecha Chaotic Metaverse begins with an interactive minting ritual where the decisions you and the community make decide the rarity of each Mecha.\n\nOwning a piece from the Bedlam NFT collection gives you access to our Discord, which allows you to participate in interactive livestreams where you help make art for the collection, read up on our Lore, interact with our Artist (Ethan S. Brewerton)[https://opensea.io/EthanSBrewerton], Play the Alpha of our game (The Umbral Catacombs), and interact with other twisted minds!\n\nWelcome to a universe riddled with madness and wreathed in mystery.\n\n[Mecha Chaotic Phase 1](https://opensea.io/collection/mecha-chaotic)"
