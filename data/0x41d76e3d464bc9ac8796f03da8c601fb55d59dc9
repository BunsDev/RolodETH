  "description": "Artbanditz x LT is a limited series of only 60 unique pieces. \n\nLT is a very awesome and talented painter (oil and acrylic paintings) who started his journey with portraits of classic composers.\nHis portraits were highly appreciated and featured in magazines, book covers and classical music festivals all around the world.\nHe has a strange and fresh POP-ART style.\n\nWhat the artist says:\nMy first paintings were portraits of classic composers. Those brought me the international success. \nAfter the composers adventure, I’ve found my style evolving into a Pop-Art painting fresh style. \nI’ve had many amazing exhibitions around the world and sold paintings to some really great celebrities in the cinema sphere especially. \nNow, life brought me face to face with the ArtBanditz. I really loved their Anon way of approaching things as I am a strange introvert myself.\nAlso, a huge colab takes place next summer at an international film festival, with a multiple awarded movie director.
