  "description": "Rekt Wolf minted on the Terra blockchain on March 3rd 2022. Early May 9th 2022, it was the 3rd biggest project by marketcap on Terra. \n\nRekt Wolf’s mission has always been to take care of the ‘’Rekt’’ and prevent people from getting ‘’Rekt’’. Unfortunately, late May 9th 2022, the ‘’stablecoin’’ UST lost its peg significantly, and it was the start of the ‘’death spiral’’ of Terra. The downturn  wiped out 45 billions off the crypto market. \n\nOur community and our team got massively ‘’Rekt’’. Savings evaporated, treasuries wiped out, time spent building lost, and the concept of decentralized money put into question.\n\nBut we are Rekt Wolf, and our motto is Rekt Today, Stronger Tomorrow. This marks a new opportunity to expand the Rekt Wolf brand, advance our DAO, develop stronger educational material, and most importantly share our wonderful community with the world! We’re all going to Rekt it wolves! #WAGRI"
