  "description": "The Fallen Heads are a collection of 3D animated 1/1 NFT's handmodeled in VR.\n\nThe Fallen Heads are gods fallen from grace, literally. These [Floating Head](https://opensea.io/collection/super-nfty-floating-heads) antagonists are cursed to float close to the earth, camouflaging themselves as their favourite [Spirits](https://opensea.io/collection/spirits-by-supernfty) and holding themselves up with whatever they have. Don't be fooled though, this group of vigilantes are powerful, armed and dangerous.\n\nUnlockables (3D files, see Floating Heads) coming soon!\n\nAlso check out the [Floating Heads Genesis collection](https://opensea.io/collection/super-nfty-floating-heads), the [Imps](https://opensea.io/collection/imps-by-supernfty), the [Spirits](https://opensea.io/collection/spirits-by-supernfty) & the [Superballs](https://opensea.io/collection/superballsnft) and read more about SuperNfty on [Supernfty.com](https://www.supernfty.com/)."
