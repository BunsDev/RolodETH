  "description": "Echoes and Whispers is a collection of photographs inspired by traditional Japanese and Chinese paintings. I have always considered it some of the oldest and most refined visual arts as it does not intend to accurately depict nature or reality, but rather to interpret natures emotional impact.\n\nWhile studying how these landscape artworks were created, I fell deeply in love with the simplicity of the concept but powerful meaning they all held. Soft layers over soothing atmospheric textures build with uplifting elements like ink, wood block texture, brush strokes, and warm colors. I felt inspired to see my landscapes differently and aimed to apply my style with bright flat areas of color, bold contour lines and a unique way of suggesting space with emphasis on foreground and background.\n\nI regard this collection as a carefully crafted and deeply meaningful dedication to this type of art that has inspired me for so long and helped me visualize a new approach to my photography.
