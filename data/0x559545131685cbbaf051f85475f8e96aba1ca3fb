  "description": "**[BUY MINT PASS](https://opensea.io/collection/radarscope-mint-pass) | [REDEEM MINT PASS](https://app.brightmoments.io/)**\n\nEphemeros • ἐφήμερος (ancient greek) is a series of 100 flowers created using AI & generative art coding techniques in collaboration with Wolfbear Studio, [namethemachine], and Dean Grenier. It explores themes of impermanence and techno mysticism in the liminal space between human and machine consciousness.\n\nEphemeros debuted April 6th at Kraftwerk Berlin as a featured collection in the [NFT ART Berlin exhibition presented by Bright Moments](https://www.brightmoments.io/berlin).\n\n---paraphrased----\n\nthe root of 'ephemera' - representations of our 'self' which is in constant flux along with the shifts of life\n\nart is an exercise of inhaling chaos and exhaling beauty\n\nwhen AI visualizes art, there are imperfections\n\ni chose flowers as something we are all familiar with; a fixture of common impermanent beauty\n\nart is an exercise of inhaling chaos and exhaling beauty"
