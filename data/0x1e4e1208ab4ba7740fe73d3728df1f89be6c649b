  "description": "Earth has run out of resources essential for the survival of humankind. Humanity is on the brink of destruction. Maybe with a little bit of luck, we can find the tools for life outside of Earth. It is up to you and your fellow explorers to go deep into the vast unknown. The final frontier. Space. To find the resources to survive. You are our last hope."
