Such a collection is meant to showcase artists who are well-known in their fields as well as emerging artists who deserve recognition. Together, both groups of artists will attract value hunters who are looking for high value at low mint prices. With this drop, MetaCollective has created a rare value, a value where all earnings are shared equally amongst the creators and artists. The collection, which consists of static and dynamic works, has 1600 NFTs in total. This collection will be a blind mint & it will be revealed in a week. Your chances of landing your dream piece of art directly correlate with the number of mints you have."
