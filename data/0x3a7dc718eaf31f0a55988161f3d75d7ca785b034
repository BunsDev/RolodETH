  "description": "The Cryptocards collection was created at the dawn of what is considered cryptoart or NFTs today being minted on January 2018. \r\n\r\nIt is the only NFT collection chronicling the history of Bitcoin until Jan 2018 with 64 cards with a total supply of 8.451.\r\n\r\nThe initial CryptoCards were issued as a ERC-20, but we developed an ERC1155 wrapper to make them available on OpenSea.\r\n\r\nBeware of other fake collections on OS.
