  "description": "Mr Doodle “ESC” is Mr Doodle’s first NFT, an animated digital artwork that brings his iconic doodles to life. It is themed around a digital and mechanical universe, presenting computers, robots and cryptocurrency-eating aliens rendered in his signature playful style. \r\n\r\nWhile traditionally Mr Doodle’s hand-drawn pieces live on canvases, large-scale installations, and fashion collaborations, “ESC” takes advantage of the new format to showcase his doodles assembling, interacting and dismantling over time. \r\n\r\nA backing soundtrack enhances the experience further by capturing a fast-paced and immense technological environment in 3D sound. \r\n\r\nThis is Mr Doodle’s first digital artwork from the five-part “ESC’’ series."
