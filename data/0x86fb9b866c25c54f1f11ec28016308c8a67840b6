  "description": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is a form of machine learning in an unsupervised manner. \n\nThis collection of 448 NFTs was created by training our GAN based on HQ Nature landscapes aswell as modern Architecture images together with our custom PKL file.\n\n The PKL file is specially trained on psychedelic / abstract images. The PKL file used to create this collection has been destroyed to ensure that the collection can never be restored and will remain unique forever."
