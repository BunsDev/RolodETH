  "description": "Every house needs a companion, in order to make it feel like a home. Likewise, Doodle Room owners might want to add a little life to their properties. This makes a perfect niche for the next entry into the Doodle Rooms ecosystem : Doodle Pets!\n\nDoodle pets is a series of 4444 meticulously curated 3-Dimensional Animals for the Metaverse. An unreal engine-powered doodle pet will be available for use in the doodle ecosystem and will be fully interactive. The Pet Pass will grant you access to a 3-dimensional metadata refresh in May 2022. These Pets can further be staked at one of the first wildlife sanctuaries created in the metaverse.\n\nDOODLE ROOMS COLLECTION - https://opensea.io/collection/doodlerooms"
