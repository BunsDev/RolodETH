For the first time, an NFT series will  showcase five sets of characters, each progressively rarer than the last: Earth Doges, Moon Doges, Journey Doges, Mars Doges, and Asteroid Doges. Did we forget to mention an additional rarer than rare ten including Elon Doge, Doge Cuban, and Billy Doge?  \n\nJoin our plucky canine space rovers as they overcome impossible odds to save earth and found a new civilization based on the principles of Dogecoin. DogeX pays homage to the most important and well known Dogecoin figures and the aspirations they have for Dogecoin.  \n \nVisit https://dogex.ai/ for more details."
