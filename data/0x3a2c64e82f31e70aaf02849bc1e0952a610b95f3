  "description": "The Outsad series of NFTs was created by artist, who has spent nearly two decades working in the fields of animation, games, and intellectual property. To complete 5000 distinct OutSad NFTs, the artist toiled for more than 700 days, combining 3000 manuscripts and 4500 modeling materials. \n\nOutsad NFT does not adhere to any one formal structure, instead emphasizing the commonplace, everyday sensations that have been obscured by the onslaught of modernity.  \n\nIn today's world, tenderness and romance are the true definitions of dignityâ€”not criticism, sarcasm, or fermentation. The utilization of subject matter, media, and cultural resources creates a limitless projection perspective and parallax transformation and directs the orientation of future historical vision.\n"
