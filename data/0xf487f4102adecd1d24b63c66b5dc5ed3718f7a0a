  "description": "Sick Ape Society is a secret community of Sick Apes that live in the ERC721A metaverse jungle. They stick together and try to survive in the era of scams and rug pulls that spoil their environment.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sickapesociety\n\nWith Sick Ape Society NFT you can participate in a p2e game to earn $LIANA tokens and breed Baby Sick Ape and 3D Sick Ape with them.\n\nSick Ape Society is a project with great utilities and long-term ambitions. We combined the best aspects of different NFT projects and created the product that gives a lot of benefits."
