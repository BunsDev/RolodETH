  "description": "东方艺术源远流长、传承千年，具有鲜明特色，是现代人回归雅士生活的寄托方式之一。沉淀千年的东方艺术，并未随着时间消失，以其深厚底蕴、精致典雅获得了年轻一代的喜爱。书画、瓷器、玉器、漆器等传统艺术品凝聚着东方艺术之美。缘起东方，闪耀世界。这批NFT是最初在文昌链打造的，通过TIBC跨链技术，途径COSMOS生态的IRISHub来到了以太坊。With a long history and thousands of years of inheritance, Oriental art has distinct characteristics and is one of the sustenance ways for modern people to return to the life of elegant scholars. The Oriental art, which has accumulated for thousands of years, has not disappeared over time, and has won the favor of the younger generation with its profound and exquisite features. Traditional works of art, such as painting, porcelain, jade and lacquer, embody the beauty of Oriental art. Originating from the East, shining in the world. This batch of NFT was originally created in Wenchang Chain, and via TIBC cross-chain technology, IRISHub came to Ethereum via COSMOS Ecology."
