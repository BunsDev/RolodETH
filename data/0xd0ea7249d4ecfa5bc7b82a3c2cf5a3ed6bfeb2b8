  "description": "ANTI-POP is an ERC-721 Contract Collection of Jake Zelinger's 1/1 expressionist works. Anti-Pop is Zelinger's outlet for pure artistic expression while doubling as his \"R&D\" area where he experiments with programmable NFTs, Dynamic NFTs, generative projects and more. \n\nThese offer no utility at this time and are not related to the Steve collections or drops related to the Steve collections. \n\nANTI-POP Editions: https://opensea.io/collection/anti-pop-editions"
