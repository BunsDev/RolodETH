  "description": "Sleight of Hand is a study of time, place and human behavior.\n\nThese candid photos were taken in the SoHo district of New York City over three sessions between May 28, 2019 and June 25, 2019. Sleight of Hand showcases the variety of moments and interactions that happen within a single 2:3 frame, in a single location, in a singular window of time. \n\nThis collection was culled down from over 400 photos to just a handful of unique moments. These images have not been edited beyond cropping, color grading and dust removal. Sleight of Hand will never be reproduced or expanded upon beyond what lives in this collection, and the location in which it was captured is no longer in existence."
