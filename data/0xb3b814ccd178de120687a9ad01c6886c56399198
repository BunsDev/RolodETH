  "description": "TheWhitelist.io Aces Collection consists of 10,000 unique digital art pieces. The term ‘ACE’, which is short for ACCESS was coined by an early community member. Each Ace is a combination of a 3D base character, 3D traits and 2D accent features—thus, creating a first-of-its-class, digital art collection. Furthermore, ultra-rare pieces in the Aces Collection have been handmade by guest artists located all over the globe. All other pieces are algorithmically generated using 14 traits and over 250 attributes.\n\nVisit https://thewhitelist.io to find out more about the ACCESS made available to an ACE hodler.\n\nProduced by Traitworks.\n\n"
