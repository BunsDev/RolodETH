  "description": "This collection is an exploration of my mind, this is how I feel and my stages in dealing with the anxiety and fear of becoming a forgotten artist. The works I am making deal with the themes of insecurity, self-doubt, anger, sadness and an overwhelming sense of anxiety.\n\nThe collection has been bubbling in me for a while, being busy with college and being overwhelmed completely with life has led to me having less and less time to make work, which I use as my form of therapy / dealing with thoughts in my head. As a result of all of this bundling stress, sadness and depression, I thought to myself “Have I really gone irrelevant? Am I able to keep up with the fast paced nature of this space?”"
