  "description": "Mr Jebus in an artist who enjoys making character illustrations, from popular media to skull ladies, from monsters that creep at the end of a dungeon to cute portaits... Mixing and matching different concepts to create funny and cool pieces.\r\n\r\nMr Jebus is a Mexican artist, so the idea of working on this collaboration with Taconomics seemed interesting to him at first glance. He draws inspiration from popular media, then added a taco twist to create these incredible pieces."
