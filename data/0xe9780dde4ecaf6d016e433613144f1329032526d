  "description": "Who we are is a reflection of the stories we tell ourselves, the past. Left with nothing more than fragments, these are the spaces that define us.\nDocumentation is our tether to understanding. For personal memory, scrapbooks have been the vehicle to return. \n\nUsing the bones of this medium, the RE- Collection incorporates photographs, assembled clippings, and a mix of found objects as a mode of translating a shared experience. Despite any evident differences, we are all subject to face the implications of our existence. Again and again, we are thrown into the end in search of our own beginning. \n\nThere is a story that leads us home, these are the pieces. \n"
