  "description": "Lost Identities is the ellipsis of time, the scales of imbalance, the resistance of density.\n\nThe first official collection of SixthRéseau houses 2000 individual avatars that serve as a RéseauGold membership pass. This brings you many rewards, access to powerful tools and to all of SixthRéseau's upcoming innovations. Be a part of it."
