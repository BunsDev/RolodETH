  "description": "Astrocryptids are cute and mysterious algorithmic pixel art sprites stored as nfts on the Ethereum blockchain. Each Astrocryptid has their own starcode and only 2901 of them will ever be minted. They are designed by a collaborative process between an etherian and a tracery cobot."
