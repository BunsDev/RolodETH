  "description": "Singularity in Heritage, an AI-driven NFT exhibition at ArtDubai Digital Booth with GAZELL.iO, brings the innovation of Eastern visual arts, crafts, traditions, motifs and transmutes it to an experiment in cultural memory. Orkhan Mammadov aims to broaden the scope of a living tradition by bringing to life these new imagined rugs, coupled with data painting techniques, thread simulation, and color data. He opens up a space for a dialogue between the past and future, dystopia and utopia, to document and preserve the vast cultural history and tradition of the NFT future. As a result, Mammadov pushes the boundaries of tradition and digital and questions technologyâ€™s role as a form of memory and a tool of power.\n\nUtility:\nEarly access to future drops\nPhysical editions of your NFT"
