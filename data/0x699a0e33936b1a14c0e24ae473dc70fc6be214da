  "description": "The first leaders of the WizBuds were called \"The Elders\". 105 of them used to discuss every important decision on \"The sacred stone table\", which led them to rule the village and the community, leading it to endless times of prosperity. Each one of these elders have some unique and specific quality that made them worthy of a spot in the stone table."
