  "description": "Non-Fungible Soup is a collection of 2048 generative Warhol-inspired vector NFTs. Created by CartySewill.com, Non-Fungible Soups are a high fidelity investigation of Warhols palette and infamous work, the 'soup cans.' \r\n\r\nAndy would have loved NFTs. And NFT art faces a lot of the same questions Warhol's faced. 10,000 digital apes seems eerily like the 2021 version of 50 soup cans or 100 Marilyns. \r\n\r\nNon-Fungible Soup owners will receive a MondrianNFT.io companion drop, by Art101.io.\r\n\r\nNon-Fungible Soups are infinitely scalable vector graphic, created with svg_stack. \r\n\r\nNon-Fungible Soups were free and minted at random on our website nonfungiblesoup.io on Aug 26th @ 11PM PDT. Provenance is in place, and our website has been mirrored on IPFS."
