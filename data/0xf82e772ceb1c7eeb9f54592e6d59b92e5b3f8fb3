  "description": "A REMIX! Collection\n\nHand Drawn Loops by Prasad Bhat is a visual exploration of duality, innovation, irony, and just pure fun! Every piece in this collection is an instant classic and timeless in its content and execution. Prasad's style is heavily influenced by his love for classical cartoon animations. Inspired by the whimsical beauty and simplicity of 1930's looped animations, Hand Drawn Loops brings a new twist to this deliberate, handcrafted artistic medium. Prasad is a self-taught artist who has spent the last 3 year honing his craft of frame by frame animation. Hand Drawn Loops is his first NFT collectible set and the culmination of years developing his style and artistic voice."
