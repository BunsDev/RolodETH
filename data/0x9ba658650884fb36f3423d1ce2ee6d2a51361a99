FROM NOW ON MOON PASSES ARE ONLY COLLECTABLES**\n\nLadies and gentleman, the 4161 MintPasses are SOLD OUT\n\nNow weâ€™re going to do a Snapshot of the holders adresses at a moment in the next 24 hours. \n\nThe only way to secure a spot for you now to mint the 12 September is to buy a Moon Pass on the secondary market on Open Sea \n\nOnly the people who hold 1 or multiple Moon Pass will be Whitelisted for the Mint for a certain number of mint depending on how much Moon Pass you have at the time of the Snapshot and if you were on the Engagement / Presale  giveaway whitelist ! \n\nFor exemple : You have 1 spot from the engagement / presale giveaway and you have 3 Moon Pass at the time of the Snapshot : you will be able to mint a total of 8 Moon Boyz : 6 Moon boyz for 3 Moon pass and 2 Moon Boyz for 1 Engagement / Presale giveaway spot \n\n Don't worry, if you are holding a Moon Pass after the mint sales it still has value and will grant you benefits in the future."
