  "description": "Bags of luggage washed up on the shores of Madagascar, where the Lemurs have lived for millennia. In the luggage, the Lemurs found clothing and accessories and began to try them on. The Lemur queen noticed the joy on each Lemurâ€™s face as she looked around at her community, showing what seemed to be a new glow. The queen decided they would travel to the metaverse to show off their threads and make new friends. They call themselves the LEMUR LEMUR troop and they get in where they fit in!\nVisit https://lemurlemur.io for more information."
