  "description": "PIXXTASY is the brainchild of Zoltán Egri, a man who overcame a two-year drug addiction and has since become a serious anti-drug advocate. His dedication to the anti-drug cause, combined with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, formed this project to help fund drug recovery programmes and NGOs through the sale of NFTs.\n\nPIXXTASY’s goal is to prevent drug use and encourage drug users to quit and recover, reaching out to young people with modern and popular methods, such as cryptocurrency and NFTs. PIXXTASY’s NFT collection will drop in small quantities (333+33+33 NFTS in different drops) with NFTs feeling premium and high quality. \n\nEach piece of 3D pixel art displayed in the page was hand drawn by a pixel artist, meaning each piece is unique and not taken from another source or generated automatically from other images."
