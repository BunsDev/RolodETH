  "description": "Angels and Devils is a collection of 10,000 hand-drawn NFTs! The collection consists of 5,000 Angels and 5,000 Devils who have agreed to put aside their differences and enter the metaverse together, as friends! This isnâ€™t just another PFP collection. Our game developers have already begun working on and producing plans for our metaverse: Celestial World, which is a story telling based MMO inspired in our Comic Book: Celestial Tales. As soon as mint ends, we start working in our second metaverse.\n\nWe welcome you to check the project and read our whitepaper.\n"
