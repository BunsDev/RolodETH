  "description": "‘Gorilla in a Pink Mask’, one of Banksy's most famous street murals, has been fractionalised into 10,000 parts, with each NFT representing the segment of the wall on which it was painted. \n\n \n\nThe artist’s fame rests on the murals he has been creating from the early 1990s. He is believed to have made more than 500 of these unique pieces. ‘Gorilla in a Pink Mask’ first appeared on the wall of the former North Bristol Social Club in Fishponds Road, Eastville, Bristol. This later became the Jalalabad Cultural Centre, where it was painted over in 2011 by the owner. In September 2020, it was removed from the centre with permission by Exposed Walls, a restoration company which now owns the work."
