  "description": "## SOLD OUT\n\nThe 3333 Genesis AlphaSkullz PFP collection is the first episode of the AlphaSkullz Trilogy on your Ethereum Blockchain.\n\nThe AlphaSkullz ecosystem: Get your Genesis Force NFT and help to raid NFT collections and share the loot. Hold your Genesis Force tight, earn $oulz, upgrade with weapons, vehicles or other equipment to gain strength within the ecosystem. Follow the story throughout Episode II and III.\n\nYour NFTs may accumulate a utility token $oulz (“soulz”) when they are staked in the smart contract. $oulz has no other functionality other than within the AlphaSkullz ecosystem, and it cannot be purchased from AlphaSkullz Developers. The Developers do not provide or intend to provide a secondary marketplace for $oulz."
