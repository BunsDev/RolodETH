  "description": "ðŸ”¥ The Genesis Fire Dyno collection is the first of four collections, followed by ðŸ’§[Water Dynos](https://opensea.io/collection/angry-dynomites-lab-water-dynos), ðŸŒ± Earth, and ðŸ’¨ Air\n\n\nVisit https://www.angrydynomiteslab.com for more details.\n\nAngry Dynomites Lab is the world's first massive co-op multiplayer game on the blockchain. Players need to unite to build artifacts to help the poor Dynomites survive. Many materials are required to create these so-called Masterpieces, making it impossible to build them for a single player alone. Therefore, the community needs to collaborate to establish a flourishing, decentralized economy powered by tokens living on the blockchain. Players need to craft materials, set up production lines, trade with each other, and optimize their production empire to keep our clumsy Dynomites alive."
