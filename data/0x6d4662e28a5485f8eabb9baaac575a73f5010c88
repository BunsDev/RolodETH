  "description": "where every monster is uniquely their own. mushies are unapologetically themselves. the mushiverse is a judgment-free, playful world, each a little different, but they coexist side-by-side in harmony. whether they are selling antler dust, inking ETH tattoos, planting shrooms or diving for fish; they always support their fellow mush. whatever life throws at them, there is always a shimmering-side; they donâ€™t take life too seriously, they celebrate it."
