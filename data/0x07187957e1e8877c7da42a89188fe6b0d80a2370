  "description": "A groundbreaking collaboration between Gucci and Superplastic, SUPERGUCCI is a two-part series of ultra-limited NFTs co-created by Gucciâ€™s Creative Director Alessandro Michele and synthetic artists Janky & Guggimon. The first drop, featuring Janky, incorporates House codes found in the Gucci Aria collection. The second drop, spotlighting Guggimon embellished with the Gucci Love Parade aesthetics, was airdropped to the holders of the first NFT as a token of gratitude. Both drops are accompanied by an exclusive 8-inch tall ceramic SUPERGUCCI sculpture, hand-crafted by ceramicists in Italy. Only 500 NFTs were minted for each drop."
