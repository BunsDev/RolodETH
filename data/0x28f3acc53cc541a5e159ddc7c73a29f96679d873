The goal is to build a decentralized community to take over the world!\nThere is a glitch with our price floor on OS due to some permission issues with a small % of listings. \n \nMigration window is NOW open. Refer to this step by step guide on how to migrate: https://youtu.be/0NIEf3pZXc0 \n\nThe new migrated collection will be at: https://opensea.io/collection/nouns3d\n\nYou will NEED to migrate for instant reveal, earn $NOUN tokens and also download your glb/fbx files.\n\nOnly 0-7399 = Genesis.
