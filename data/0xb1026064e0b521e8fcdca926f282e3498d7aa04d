  "description": "After eight months of developing with a team of 30+ people, the time to go into the alpha testing stages is upon us. To celebrate, we are doing a one-off (never to be done again) initial room offering of our Genesis apartments. Rooms will be the most valuable assets in the game, these room NFTs will give you a massive edge in the game and will be extremely rare. \n\nIn our game, it’s possible to buy rooms from other players, find them in a few boosterpacks, or win them in community competitions. But as in real life, rooms are one of the rarest things to find in the Tower. People want to move in, so it’s time to create that edge if you want to start your journey as a business owner in the Tower.\n\nThis initial room offering celebrates Cryptopolis going into the alpha stages. Do you want to be one of the high-rollers that starts their real estate portfolio before anyone else? Here is your chance."
