  "description": "ApeDocs is the first ever NFT collection for healthcare workers, made by a team of doctors. We are building the best online community of healthcare workers (and enthusiasts) the world has ever seen. Our generative art collection represents the entire spectrum of healthcare (doctors, nurses, dentists, nutritionists, physical therapists etc.), and was hand drawn by our sole artist (Shirin Syed, MD). The founders of ApeDocs (Shirin & Usama) are both medical doctors working in New York, whilst also being content creators on Instagram (@halalgirlnewyork and @realskindoctor, combined following of 200,000). ApeDocs NFTs not only provide the best digital artwork for healthcare workers to relate with in the NFT space, they are also utility NFTs unlocking partner perks (medical apparel, education, device and training) with a combined value at launch of >$700, and growing each day. \r\n\r\nWe are not a typical NFT project, and we're not looking for traders/flippers. Come join a project with substance."
