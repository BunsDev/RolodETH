  "description": "‘Everything Is Energy’ is Chromakane’s first collection which bridges physical and digital art, connecting unique hand painted streetwear and limited edition art prints with an exclusive collection of art NFTs.\n\nThe collection explores identity and self-expression, through the lens of nine cultural masks from around the world. Historically, masks have been used in ceremonies and performing arts, to convey an emotion, tell a story, or embody an otherworldly persona. Through these masks, the hope for ‘Everything Is Energy’ is to challenge conventions and stereotypes surrounding identity and question the energies which we manifest and surround ourselves with. A culturally-sensitive collection, born for art collectors around the world."
