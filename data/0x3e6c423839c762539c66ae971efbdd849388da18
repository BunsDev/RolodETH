  "description": "Arguably one of the most exciting illustrators in Taiwan, Jody Tseng (Brave Animated Series, Netflix) comes to Supermeta+ to helm a brand new animation IP - Project J. The story features an eclectic cast of characters in an advanced utopian future where the human consciousness is able to take the form of beast-like spirits.\n\nAn exclusive collection of 888 NFTs, featuring 100 unique traits hand drawn in an aesthetic reminiscent of such classics by Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira) and Ken Sugimori (Pokemon), Project J promises to be a visually inventive origin story for anime and manga fans.\n\nhttps://www.supermetaplus.com/ \n -  https://www.instagram.com/jodytsengart/"
