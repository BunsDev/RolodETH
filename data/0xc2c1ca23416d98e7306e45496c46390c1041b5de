  "description": "Having designed some of the world’s finest megayachts, yacht design firm Gregory C. Marshall Naval Architect Ltd. has built a reputation as one of the top naval architecture firms in the world. For more than 35 years, founder Greg Marshall and his business partner, naval architect Gordon Galbraith, have designed ever-larger megayachts, and a commercial craft for a wide variety of clientele. As with any life-long dream, it started early with Greg.\n\nGreg’s father, Victoria architect Donovan Marshall, recognized his son’s obsession and introduced him to Bill Garden, the famed yacht designer. Garden asked the 15-year-old Greg to sketch a yacht for a customer. Greg made batches of drawings and when the opportunity presented itself, Garden offered him a few weeks of drafting work after High School. In 6 years under the tutelage of Bill Garden, Greg amassed the skills and practical approach to yacht design that has served him to this day."
