  "description": "**[CryptoCitizens](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptocitizensofficial) | [Roadmap](https://www.brightmoments.io/) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/f6Gmh2ATgx)**\n\nA Golden Token Mexico City (GTMX) NFT provides the holder with a claim to mint 1 of 1,000 CryptoMexas through an IRL mint experience this November.\n\nThe GTMX was used as an eligibility requirement for the Mexico City Collection Dutch Auction. The snapshot took place on September 15 at 22:00 PT. Purchasing a GTMX after this time does not provide access to the Dutch Auction."
