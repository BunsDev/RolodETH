  "description": "MondrianNFT is a Collection of 4096 Provably-Rare Generative Mondrian-Inspired Vector NFT Abstracts. Spanning the entirety of Piet's multiple styles, phases, and formats, with rarity that reflects his real-world collection.\n\nArt101.io's MondrianNFT accurately reflects each phase of Mondrian's collection as generative infinitely scalable vector graphics. (PNG included) Created by Carty Sewill (CartySewill.com) of Art101 (https://art101.io), it's much more than computer-generated blocks.\n\nWith an added crypto-spin, Mondrian NFT is a fun high-fidelity homage. MondrianNFT.io is a humanist take on generative art. Each one has small imperfections like cracked paint and jagged lines. You can easily edit and inspect your MondrianNFT with FOSS software like Inkscape."
