  "description": "A 6.9 ETH Bomb exploded and out of the ashes rose Muleman, a selfless leader for the people. When Muleman would enter the room, the energy was contagious, and soon, an entire movement was formed, which has become The Mulesquad. \n\nComprised of over 200 unique traits, each member of the Mulesquad is individually unique, yet similar, in that we’ve all come together for the greater good of the metaverse, and to dominate the NFT space by empowering each and every Mule in the squad.\n\nMulesquad NFT holders will receive the following: Daily Alpha, Early whitelist access into some of the best NFT projects, access to the highest level Nansen research/data, Muleman’s daily thoughts on the NFT market/overall sentiment, request custom project reviews, and much more to come.\n\nThe Mulesquad motto has always been to under promise, over deliver.
