  "description": "Stefan Mathez is toomuchlag, a Swiss, London-based multidisciplinary visual artist and director. Known for his futuristic works, toomuchlag explores the dichotomy of light and dark, creating iconography that blends the dystopian and the celestial.\r\n\r\nThe collection \"My Journey\" is inspired by the great classic Italian literature Divina Commedia. Combining toomuchlag's visual art with original music made as his duo Fibonoire, the five pieces outline the beginning of his journey and a reckoning with oneself through sins, pain, and reflection. This is the initial descent towards enlightenment, self-improvement and whatever else might await."
