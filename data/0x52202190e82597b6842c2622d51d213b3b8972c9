  "description": "The Moon In Motion is a very special NFT. The art is completely on chain (no external links), yet every day it will be different.\n\nThe Moon shifts its phase like our Moon does.\n\nInspired by the Mutant Garden and the_coin, I wanted to create a 100% immutable token (no external assets, totally on chain) which could still mutate over time.\n\nEach moon has a different amount of editions, based also on how rarely the given moon occurs. The Neon Moon is a unique piece."
