  "description": "PixelWooks is an NFT project to build a live music community and push the boundaries of Phan Art. Ownership is your ticket into the JamDAO which will change the way live music is performed in the Metaverse. There are 5,000 unique wooksâ€”many of which you probably know or have at least bought drugs from. **Check out discord for more info: https://discord.gg/JTdvNkXRAZ**"
