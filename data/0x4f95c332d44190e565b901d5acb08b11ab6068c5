  "description": "As an emerging hub for digital art and NFTs, “The New Digital: Born in Chicago” showcases the many ways Chicago inspires creativity — from the city’s architecture, to the culture of the Midwest, and its vibrant neighborhoods. \r\n\r\nThis genesis exhibition from imnotArt Chicago features seven artists who were born or raised in Chicago, each with work reflecting a unique aspect of this great city.  Together, starting with this exhibition, we are building something special right here in the 312. Welcome to The New Digital."
