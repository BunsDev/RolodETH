  "description": "each vibe can claim a 1-of-1 print + discounts on relics: https://vibes.art/  \n\nvibes is a collection of generative artworks, randomly created at the moment of mint, seeded by blockhash, and immutably stored on ethereum as on-chain html. capturing a vibe is like bottling a droplet from the ocean; each piece is the tiniest glimpse of an unknowably large set of combinatorial outcomes, defined by the math and curated constraints of the code."
