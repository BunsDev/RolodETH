  "description": "LIT Project Two is a reflection, an exploration of the dynamic interplay between market volatility and emotional volatility. This reactive NFT watches Ethereum at all times and responds to its movements. Do you do the same? This technology is alive. By responding to its motions, we create the culture in symbiotic relationship.\n\nStarring Robert De Niro.\n\nSmart contract & metadata created by Transient Labs"
