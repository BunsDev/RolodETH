  "description": "Nine factions populate the virtual space. While Utopians develop the main net, the others work on their nodes building an economy system over the secondary chains.\nEach station is focusing on one activity but thereâ€™s some dangers out there: Scammers and Hackers trying to survive doing obscure things.\nThere are also some drafts and blueprints of stations waiting for a faction to buy and build them. Who knows what its final purpose will be.\n\nThis project plays with procedural architectonic structures. Iâ€™m using a sci-fi style to present a virtual world populated by space station-like structures.\n\nUse Mouse to Control the Camera.\nClick: Stop Rotation.\nDouble Click: Reset Auto Rotation.\nPress Any Key to Change Background Mode. Space -> Stripped -> Fog -> Transparent"
