  "description": "Minting closes September 5th: https://miragegallery.ai/dreamers\n\nMirage Gallery is creating a web3 gallery that contains all sorts of innovative AI art.\n\nWhen we started seeing PFP projects take off, we did not yet feel able to create a collection on a large scale that represented the gallery as a whole.\n\nPFPs were the one style of art we had not yet explored, and we feel it was the missing piece to round out the full Mirage Gallery collection.\n\nThe Dreamers project has been over 6 months in the making, and will be a large stepping stone in growing the Mirage Gallery community.\n\n"
