  "description": "BANZAI is inspired from the Japanese war cry and represents \"ten thousand years\" of long life. Our collection is inspired from the same beliefs and combines cutting-edge technology with traditional manga values.\n\nBANZAI is a boutique collection with a limited supply of 999 to keep our family a tight knit circle. We are more than a NFT project, BANZAI is a media company concentrated on pushing forward the innovation of Web3 and it's future builders."
