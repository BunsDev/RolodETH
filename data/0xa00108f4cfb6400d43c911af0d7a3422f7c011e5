  "description": "#**P2E beta is live**\n#** Companions (Mint is live) - https://opensea.io/collection/shines-companion**\n189 years from now in 2211, 3332 girls were born, in different parts of the world. The strange thing was, that the women who gave birth to them, had no idea they were pregnant. All of them are adopted by self-made billionaire Dr. Rays who strongly believes that the earth will be under attack soon by civilizations from different galaxies, and these supernatural kids are the only chance for humanity to survive. So she built a special home for these children to raise and train them, helping them discover their abilities. After 6 years of training, the children revealed themselves as the soldiers of 4 Elements, meaning that they each can affect and control one of the 4 elements. Now they have reached 11 years, which means they are ready for extensive training. After completing their training, they will be ready to leave their home and take their positions in different parts of the world."
