  "description": "268 original drawings created on paper, using colored pencil, graphite, ink and watercolor plus 7 works painted in acrylic on wood panels. Now with the digital Lightbody Collection their imagery literally glows. \n\nThe Lightbody is a recurring archetype in the history of Art. Ancient petroglyphs show solarized figures with haloes and rays of light emanating from the body.  Appearing in the earliest icons of Hindu, Buddhist and Christian art are portrayals of haloes, auras, chakras, all manner of glowing life energies that, through paintings and sculpture, make the subtle visionary worlds visible, symbolically merging physical human forms with the light of spirituality."
