  "description": "##MINTED OUT!\n   *With our \"Mint Out\" we are focused on building out our current single largest utility, Charity TNT (TNT).  \nEach NFT Hold gets 50,000 of our TNT tokens simply for owning a F-bomb NFT.  \n\nOur F-Bombs discovered a doorway to the real world. It turns out, the F-Bombs had been observing their human creators and plotting their escape. While waiting for the perfect moment, they absorbed knowledge from the blockchain and developed intelligence far greater than anticipated. Then, they broke free to run loose in the world! \n\nVisit our Website [F-BOMB CENTRAL](https://fbombcentral.com/)\nJoin our [discord](https://discord.gg/WTddYhyrz8)"
