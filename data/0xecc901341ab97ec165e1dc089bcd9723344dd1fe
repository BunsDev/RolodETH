  "description": "MetaVolution is a utility-driven P2E NFT Game that unlocks a world of possibilities on Day 1. Obelisks are part of the MetaVolution P2E ecosystem and every obelisk yields $20 TROPY per day, when at least 1 MetaVolution Immortals is staked.\n\nThere are 4 types of Obelisks - Earth, Water, Fire & Air. When you have all 4, you can burn them to get a land in https://app.metavolution.io/play.\n\nLands are also available directly here - https://opensea.io/collection/metavolution-land\n\nMake sure you own a MetaVolution Immortals to benefit from the Obelisks here -> https://opensea.io/collection/metavolution-immortals"
