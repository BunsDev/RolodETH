  "description": "# Live art collaboration as dynamic NFTs\n\nMint a uniquely named Canvas and let your community collaborate on what should be painted on it.\n\nPixlet Studio is a real-time, collaborative NFT experiment where individuals and teams can come together to create a unique piece of art on shared canvasses. Anyone can mint a uniquely named pixel art Canvas and let their community collaborate on what should be painted on it. The canvas label is unique, meaning if you mint the “Elon Musk” canvas, nobody else can mint one with the same label. Every few minutes, the new pixel changes are reflected in the image in your NFT wallet."
