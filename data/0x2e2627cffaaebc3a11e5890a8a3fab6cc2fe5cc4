  "description": "# A collection of 7210 Doodmas Delights\nDoodmas Delights takes a Christmas spin on byburnttoast’s Doodles collection!  \n10 of 1/1s will be on auction, others will be minted for free!  \nThe collection consists of 7,210 unique, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain.  \nThere exist 135 hand-drawn traits, with unique generative algorithms created for each base Doodmas and 20 purely hand-drawn Doodmas’.  \nOur goal is to spread the gift-giving spirit, and to educate our friends and family about NFTs and the space that we love! We believe that Doodmas Delights can play a role in spreading Doodles, and the NFT space as a whole, across the mainstream into popular adoption.  "
