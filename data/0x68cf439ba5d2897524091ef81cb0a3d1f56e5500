  "description": "BitBots are community-driven collectibles of algorithmically generated robotic characters. Our society comes in a wide range of colors, traits and sizes with a collection size of 9,999. \nBecoming a BitBot provides musicians the ability to become their own brand. For those who are not musicians, the BitBot Society expansion into the Metaverse includes useable 3D assets & more. In the future, BitBot owners will have access to IRL events, merchandise, & more.\n\nOther BitBot Collections:\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/bitbotsocietyxleemajor"
