  "description": "The Fly Now Space Club is a collection of 119 unique Astronaut NFTs— exclusive and human made digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Astronaut gives you a membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to “THE CONTROL ROOM”, a collaborative board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation. Visit www.FlyNowSpaceClub.com.br for more details."
