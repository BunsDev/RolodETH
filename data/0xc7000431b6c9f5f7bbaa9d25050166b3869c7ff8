  "description": "The Shiba Vikings Clan is an exclusive community for the leader of all Shibas. Our collection of full-body Shibas in 4K quality presents the most creative and highest detail in the NFT space. \n\nClan members receive passive income in $Shib rewards simply for holding our NFT. As if that wasnâ€™t enough, members will be able to participate in a play-to-earn fight game, where holders can earn money, upgrade their Vikings with in-game assets, and hang out with fellow Vikings. \nOur members are like family, and together we will conquer the metaverse."
