  "description": "Colorglyphs are an extension of Larva Labs' peerless Autoglyphs project. Each Colorglyph is a colorful version of an Autoglyph. Colorglyphs turns the black elements in an Autoglyph colorful, using hex colors drawn from the address of the Colorglyph's creator.  Buying a Colorglyph is not the same as buying an Autoglyph."
