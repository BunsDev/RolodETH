  "description": "What community has a hip hop song written about them?\n\nRapper Styles P joined our discord all of the way back in January 2022. This was his first trip into the metaverse, and the Wall St Bulls quickly took to the legendary rapper. We immediately made him an honorary Mooner Bull and in turn, he made a song about our NFT community. We were so honored, we are dropping a very special edition of 111 animated NFTs for the culture to personally own. All hodlers get full license of the song and animation. WAGMI"
