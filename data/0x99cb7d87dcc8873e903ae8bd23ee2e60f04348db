  "description": "⊹ Hand Painted on a real carpet with SprayPaint and Brushes \n⊹ Faces Animated with AI to give them life in the Virtual World\n⊹ Hand-made 1/1 by Mateo.\n\nCarpet Avatar is a novative process to animate digitally my artworks on Rugs.\nA new merge between Urban Art, Traditional Craft and Artificial Intelligence.\n\nPaintings on Rug reflects an amazing way to pay homage to diversity in human cultures. Each waving of these carpets serves as the background for stunning female faces that are culturally bound to the pattern of the weaving itself.\n ↠ Mateo paints in the streets since 2005 and is now exhibited in Art Galleries worldwide along with renowned artists."
