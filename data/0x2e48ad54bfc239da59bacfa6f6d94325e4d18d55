  "description": "Woof’s minions is a limited edition NFT event born out of the DeFi community’s love and appreciation for Woof Decentra. Woof Decentra is known for being an ex-dev on $SHIB, the deployer of $LEASH, $KUMA and the founder of $STARL and $DBUY. 20 Minions will spawn on October 30 and all have different set of attributes, levels of rarity and designs. \n\nThis event is brought to you by the DBUY team."
