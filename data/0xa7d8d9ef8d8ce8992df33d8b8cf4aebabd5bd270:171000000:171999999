  "description": "Himinn is a painterly cloud study exploring light, color, and the generative composition of clouds in the sky. The algorithm creates natural forms and the illusion of ever-changing atmosphere through carefully structured layers of color and shape. Himinn means “a sky”, and it has been incredibly fun to paint the skies with code.  \n"
