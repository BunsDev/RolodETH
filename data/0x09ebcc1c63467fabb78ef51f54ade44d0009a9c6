  "description": "Popeye the Sailor Man is partnering with UNDONE, the world’s leading custom watch brand, and MADworld to release an exclusive NFT collection.\n\nIn the beginning the Universe was created. Something broke… that’s all we can say and now, there’s thousands of Popeyes stranded in universes they don’t belong to, running amok in shoes that no longer fit them, scratching their noggins, wondering about tattoos they don’t recognize…\n\nHowever, this Popeye seems to know the drill like the back of his hand (or at least where it used to be), as he slips on a peculiar high-tech watch-like device…” \n\nHelp the Popeyes achieve singularity again and back to their old selves by gathering Popeyes with parts that belong to the same universe!\n"
