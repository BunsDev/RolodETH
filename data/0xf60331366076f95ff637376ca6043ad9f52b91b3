  "description": "My name is Amir Zaki. This project, California Concrete, depicts empty skateparks photographed at dawn. They depict complex, poured concrete formations created by carving into and excavating large open areas of land within city parks. These refined spaces are born out of conceptions of the various curvilinear shapes of ocean waves and other hilly natural landscape forms but frozen and cemented permanently like Brutalist architecture. There is an accompanying book that includes an introduction by Tony Hawk."
