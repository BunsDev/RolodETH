  "description": "Seed Capital is a sculpture that suggests ways to rethink the economic and ecological relationships between artworks, viewers and institutions. The sculpture functions as a technologically augmented organic system which engages in social and financial contracts with its environment. \n\nSeed Capital is designed to take place over the course of four exhibitions, the first of which is the Fingerprints DAO booth at Art Dubai 2022, running from March 9, 2pm GST to March 13, 8pm GST."
