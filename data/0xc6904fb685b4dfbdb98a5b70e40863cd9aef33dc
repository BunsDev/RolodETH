  "description": "# **FREE TO MINT FOR ALL [BLAZED CATS](https://blazedcats.com) HOLDERS**\n\nWhat pairs nicely with a Blazed Cat? A big yellow head, of course. Probably the mutated, decapitated remains of a [dipshit](https://islandboys.wtf), but at least they've got style.\n\n- > 0xHeads are distributed on an inverse rarity to [BLAZED CATS](https://blazedcats.com). The least rare cats yield the rarest heads.\n- > Each [BLAZED CAT](https://blazedcats.com) has an indicator in the top left corner showing whether their 0xHEAD has been claimed.\n- > HAMM Draw by [Andrew Hamm](https://twitter.com/hamm_day)"
