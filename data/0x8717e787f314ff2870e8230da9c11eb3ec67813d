  "description": "Strokers is a golf community unlike any other. NFT memberships that grant you access to the best experiences, gear and people golf has to offer. The future of our game is here.\n\nWe started building Strokers in October 2021 and have taken our time to ensure the security of our contracts, our artwork is phenomenal, and partnerships have been secured. Our NFT’s will bring a lot of short-term joy and excitement to our holders with so much more value coming down the road as well. We are fully funded pre-mint. This is a long-term project focused on having a lot of fun building a great community around golf. We will be revealing partnerships leading up to the day of our mint. Expect a TON of great announcements. There will be 3333 unique pieces of art generated randomly with hundreds of rare attributes and real-life golf perks.\nThe perks that come with Stroker NFT’s include\n►Discounted Golfing Rates & Gear\n►Community Access\n►Stroker Mobile App\n►Sandbox Game\n►Exclusive Events"
