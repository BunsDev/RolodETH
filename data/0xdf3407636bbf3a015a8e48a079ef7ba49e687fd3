  "description": "The black portal suddenly opened and 10,000 ghosts came over from the other dimension. Let's call out the ghosts, hear their voices, and revive the memories. Turn on your camera and be possessed by the ghost.\r\n\r\n**About [MrMisang](https://opensea.io/MrMISANG?tab=created)**:\r\n\r\nMrMisang is building his own dystopian world called \"Modern Life is Rubbish(MLIR)\". GhostsProject is his brand new PFP project where NFT avatars copy their users' facial expressions using motion capturing technology.\r\n\r\n[Website](https://ghostsproject.com/) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/ghostsproject) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mrmisang/) | [SuperRare](https://superrare.com/mrmisang/creations)"
