  "description": "“HELLFIRE” is a compositional system in which hellscapes are generated and fused with Beeple’s exceptional #Everyday works.\n\nThe main environmental parameter of the composition is the underlying #Everyday image. The #Everyday determines the hellscape’s colors and defines specific phenomena for each of them, such as “HELL” texts, framing decisions, color composition, and character elements. The hellscape has several possible variables, which can be major: characters, faces, or micro: red hues and dark undertones. The algorithm, most of the time, takes the colors present in the #Everydays, breaks the boundary between them, generating chromatic masses.\n\nBEEBLE WORLD: https://opensea.io/collection/beeble-world/\nGenesis OS: https://opensea.io/collection/beeble-genesis\nSlice of Heaven OS: https://opensea.io/collection/slice-of-heaven-by-beeble"
