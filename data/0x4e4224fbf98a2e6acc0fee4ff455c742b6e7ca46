  "description": "Jason Seifeâ€™s work references old Persian carpets, an art form that in modern times is often taken for granted. Carpets were a large part of his childhood growing up with immigrant parents of Middle Eastern descent. Jason recreates these old weavings by tediously painting them on canvas in colors and mediums that were not normally used in their origin."
