  "description": "IMPORTANT PLEASE READ: This is the official Collection of \"Summer Vibes Official\".\nTo protect our holders and community against scams and lookalike collections during the mint phase, we changed the name of our collection on Opensea. \n\nAs Summer Vibes is not following traditional NFT marketing tactics, our mint is taking time. This has given scammers the opportunity to recreate our website, paid ads, and Opensea pages. We believe that changing our Opensea collection name will make it more difficult for scammers to find our page and reproduce fraudulent copies. \n\nAfter all NFTs have been sold, we will revert back to the official name. Thank you for your understanding.\n\n\nORIGINAL DESCRIPTION:\nSummer Vibes is a collection of 10,000 unique Vibes with several exciting levels of rarity.\nSummer Vibes features hundreds of quirky, summer-focused elements that will take you out of your drab winter surroundings and give you the Summer Vibes your soul is longing for."
