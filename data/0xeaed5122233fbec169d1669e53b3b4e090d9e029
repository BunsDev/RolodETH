  "description": "Remember the 60’s when the Beatles saved Pepperland from the Blue Meanies in the Yellow Submarine? Jose Delbo was the cartoonist responsible for illustrating the Fab Four with Gold Key Comics. Jose Delbo is an Argentinian born artist who published his first work at the age of only 16. Delbo’s career took an important turn in July of 2020 when Delbo released his first piece of digital art on the blockchain in the form of a 43 page original digital comic book called Death. Since then, Delbo has become a staple in the crypto art scene bringing his classic comic art style to the digital world."
