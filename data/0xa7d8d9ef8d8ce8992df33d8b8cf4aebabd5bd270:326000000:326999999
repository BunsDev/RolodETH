  "description": "In the right hand, a pen can effortlessly reveal the most characteristic features of a person, inside and out. Following the twist and turn of the line, echoes of practice and repetition, the path becomes a walk through the recesses of a subconscious human mind. Total Strangers pays tribute to this time-honoured flight of the human creativity, generating a rogueâ€™s gallery of faces from a continuous fluid line and a virtual pencil case of select drawing tools. We invite you to follow the line as it goes for a walk. Watch it unfold and give life a cast of unique characters, reflections of those around us.\n\n[P] - Pause\n[B] - Toggle transparent background\n[F] - Performance-agnostic desired frame rate.
