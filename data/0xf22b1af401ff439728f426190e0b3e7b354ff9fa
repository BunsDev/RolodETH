Larger plots provide Holders with increased resource production efficiency, rare weapon drops, more visibility on the 3D Maps and more governance power in the Federation.\n\n[3D Map](www.oxyaorigin.com) | [Avatars](https://opensea.io/collection/oxyaoriginproject) | [Whitepaper](https://docsend.com/view/f8gnhc4kiw5dizhb)"
