  "description": "Minting is live! [Mint your Skull Trooper Here](https://mint.deadheads.io).\n\nSkull Troopers are part of the [DeadHeads](https://deadheads.io) universe, and are the common enemy in the NFT underworld. They are an army of ruthless gangsters trying to hunt down the 3 keys to the Underworld Elevator and stop Damien from fulfilling his destiny. For how evil these troopers may seem, they themselves are terrified of the power and malevolent nature of their boss (currently known as “The Big Boss”).\n\n[Watch Animated Series Episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAVFCIX08r0&t=28s)"
