After years of doing his own research, Toby decided to leave his pasture life to embark on what will be the biggest adventure of his life. Determined to put goats in the history books, Toby moved to the Ethereum blockchain to be the first goat to go to the moon.\n\nCheck our roadmap and utility token at:\nhttps://tobythegoat.io\n\n\n"
