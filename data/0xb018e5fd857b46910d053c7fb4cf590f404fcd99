  "description": "Think the pieces in this gallery are still images? Think again! Every piece is continually evolving based on the time of day, all without needing to refresh metadata. You'll see each photograph slowly fade through daytime, sunset, nighttime, and sunrise, as they are synchronized with actual sunrise and sunset times from your exact geographical location. This also means the length of day and night change seasonly! At any given moment, what you see will be different than what someone else sees from across the planet. This revolutionary approach to NFT photography is only made possible through custom written, programmable smart contracts. Welcome to the groundbreaking Transient Gallery, where landscape photography has become tethered to the real world."
