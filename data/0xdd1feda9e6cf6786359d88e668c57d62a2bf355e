  "description": "Cryptopus is a upcoming collection of cute octopus NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain. The Cryptopus has five arms, three hearts, nine brains — and one plan. Save the Ocean. To execute this mission, he needs your help to clean the Ocean from plastic pollution and reduce climate change to stop the coral bleeching. Coral reefs are the most diverse habitats on the planet and provide a home for millions of species. In the last 30 years, we have lost over 50% of the world´s corals by virtue of global warming. The Cryptopus Family is trying to decrease this number with help of the blockchain Technology."
