  "description": "In partnership with *Tatler China* and the artist [David Ariew](https://twitter.com/DavidAriew), TR Lab is pleased to announce the online sale of David's NFT artwork, *Fractal Monarch*. This collaboration marks a milestone: when a still image from David Ariew's digital artwork *Fractal Monarch* appears on the cover of *Tatler China*, it marks the first NFT to do so on a Chinese magazine. TR Lab is honored to facilitate the sale of the artwork, and half of the sale proceeds will be donated to global nonprofit organization Save The Children Hong Kong.\n\nDavid Ariew's *Fractal Monarch* depicts a futuristic digital insect rendered in black and gold to correspond with Tatler's theme colors. The work was inspired by the phenomenon of the butterfly effect, and symbolizes how a small contribution can make a large impact on a child's future. "
