  "description": "The BAPES™ Genesis I collection is made up of 1850+ Strong Holders with over 2100/2300 (≈91%) of the tokens staked into the BAPES™ Life Pod here: https://opensea.io/0x04a3957635ab968c4b92681d6082fc61ff080c5f - Every BAPES™ NFT Holder is considered a metavestor, earning continuous metawards and metavends, via a special Meta ATM Application, from all of the projects and companies that the BAPESCLAN™, as a collective, votes to metavest in, from the BAPES™ Metafund, or support via the BAPES™ Tellus Launchpad. This is a utility within the NFT space, never before seen."
