  "description": "The City is engraved in its inhabitants, who in turn engrave themselves unto each other, not knowing how, when, or why. Identities disappear, dissipate and dilute into the roaring crowd. One question clouds my mind as I stand still observing through my cameraâ€™s big wide eye: Will it swallow me whole? Will we become one? One more tag on the wall? One more chewing gum on the ground, stepped on by the weight of the mass, becoming thus the texture of every day, of everyone? "
