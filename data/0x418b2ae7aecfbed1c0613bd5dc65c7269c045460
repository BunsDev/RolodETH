  "description": "Chad is more than just a freelance artist, he is the Head of 3D Design at Nike and not so long ago retired from an exciting career as a professional skateboarder that ran from 1998-2011. Nowadays, when he isn’t working for Nike, his unique artwork is enjoyed by people around the world. Chad Knight’s vibrant digital art moves between the meditative and the frenetic. the artist’s personal work seems to exist in alien worlds, with his works being made in Cinema 4D. These are places inhabited by enormous elaborate beings that appear in mid-evolution. The artist posts a new creation each day on his Instagram account as part of an ongoing, prolific effort."
