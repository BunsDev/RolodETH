The [Opensea Shared Storefront Version](https://opensea.io/collection/unoffical-trash-punks) is now swappable for the official token of each punk. More info on the [TRASHPUNKS](https://trashpunks.com) Website.  Hodlers of at least two TRASHPUNKS from generation 1 (1-167) will receive airdrops of offspring produced by their TRASHPUNKS.  TrashPunks are an artistic parody. [Created by iH0DL](https://twitter.com/ih0dl)\nEach Trash Punk will be manually trashed using digital techniques - most likely procreate - to make these little bastards the trashiest punks in town."
