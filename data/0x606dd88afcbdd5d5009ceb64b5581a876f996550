  "description": "WATERFALLS is a collection of 100 digital animations created by Nicolas Sassoon using a moiré patterning technique, consisting in the overlap of two images to generate the illusion of third image. This imaging process is central in Sassoon’s practice, through which he manifests abstract and kinetic works referencing natural and atmospheric forces. In WATERFALLS, the animations appear on screen as endlessly hypnotic surfaces similar to all-over paintings or wallpapers, oscillating between depth and flatness, abstraction and figuration. Natural forces become mediated using a visual language of digital abstraction, generating contemplative experiences reminiscent of both the natural and the digital. "
