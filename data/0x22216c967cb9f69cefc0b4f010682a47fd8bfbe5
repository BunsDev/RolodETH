  "description": "Welcome to the Guild of Tigers  - the FIRST FULLY 3D ANIMATED Tiger NFTs to take over the jungle.\n\nEach high-quality Tiger is algorithmically generated using over 500 properties/traits, giving you a completely distinctive 3D model of your Tiger thanks to a unique rarity algorithm developed by the Guild of Tigers team.\n\nAlthough the Tiger is typically a solitary animal, a group of Tigers is known as ‘an ambush’ and the Tigers Guild Ambush will only have 8,888 members living on the Ethereum blockchain."
