  "description": "Shibuya Girls is a Genesis collection of 1.836 unique girls from Shibuya now living on the Ethereum blockchain as NFTs.\n\nOn the Z Line, the train is coming at the Shibuya Station; 22:00, on time, as usual.\nPassengers have a slight, tired smile on their faces. They're finally coming home after a stressful day.\nSuddenly, strange metallic noises are heard from the outside. As they're getting more intense and annoying, the train starts to jolt violently, while gaining speed.\nThe Shibuya Station is close but the train is going too fast to make a stop.\nAs the train is about to arrive at the station, while the passengers are still wondering what's going on, a sudden blinding light appears out of nowhere.\nThe cabins disappear right in front the incredulous bystanders waiting for the train.\nThe passengers are glued to the windows as a station never seen before is coming into view.\nA voice announce:\n«We are now arriving at Ethereum Shibuya Station»."
