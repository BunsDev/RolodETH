  "description": "Once a respected pioneer in the Elarium mining sector, 112 years of overreaching ambition and greed saw Zoff Industries slowly warp into an authoritarian oppressor.\n\nNow known only as Zoff, the totalitarian organization seeks to assert its stranglehold dominion across the Twinned Galaxies through total military dominance.\n\nAlthough the Director rules with an iron fist from the shadows, Zoff soldiers are focused and loyal, finding solace in the stability, structure, and security that the powerful organization provides."
