  "description": "Rapture is a series exploring magical seals overflowing their boundaries, gradually dissolving into the surroundings. It is imagined as abstract iconography for a fictional mystic religion. Rapture is the conclusion of a system I have been working with and perfecting over several years and it is the first time that it is presented completely autonomous. The series consists of computationally heavy art pieces, with calculations happening while the seal shake to contain its powers. 25% of the proceeds from this project will go to the preservation of the Ecuadorian rainforest Bigai through Randers Rainforest Wildlife Foundation."
