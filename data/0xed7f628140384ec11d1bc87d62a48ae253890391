  "description": "# Paintings Talk! \n\nThis is the narrative of a woman who painted her feelings. A narrative with prominent female characters.\n\n- My Vision: Humans are perpetually on the move, often unclear of their destination. Regardless of your destination, how you get there is more important than where you are going.\nI want to explore new love and art expressions. I'd like to propose a new way of presenting these definitions.  \n**An Inner Journey!**\nI'd like to take you to a place I've always desired through my paintings.\n"
