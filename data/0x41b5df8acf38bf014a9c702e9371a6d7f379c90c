  "description": "A limited NFT collection of 10,000 hand-drawn urban Cupid angels. The NFT is also an entry pass for an exclusive urban Metaverse block where a bunch of Cupids found asylum.\n\nThere was a time when people used to go out in bars and clubs, meet privately, or causally on the streets... Now that apes and cats in funky costumes began to conquer the neighborhoods (precedented by an army of digital punks ofcourse), what is left for cupid to do?\nCupids found asylum in the Metaverse where they occupied a chain of blocks in the suburbs, still looking at apes, cats and punks in funky costumes. The rest of the story is to be written â€“ Join us to be part of it!"
