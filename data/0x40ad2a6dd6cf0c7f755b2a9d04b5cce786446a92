  "description": "Just Slow Down is the genesis collection made by two time-lapse lads (popsto & NJ) from the Arctic Circle.\n\nWe want you to take a step back, observe what's around you and enjoy the little things in life. Go out for a walk, spend time with your love ones and focus on things that *actually* matter in your life.\n\nThis collection was born out of our own need to escape the real world, and now we hope our work can help you to do the same - to just slow down."
