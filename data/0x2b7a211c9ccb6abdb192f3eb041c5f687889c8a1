  "description": "Waveform Collapse is a generative art collection, inspired by the Quantum Mechanics* concept that the universe collapses into reality by our act of observing (minting) it.\n\nThe art in this collection is generated using an autonomous system that uses the collector's unique transaction Hash after they mint an NFT. The act of minting collapses the waveform system into art. This will be a rolling reveal since all this is done by hand.\n\nIâ€™ve created an interlinked complex generative system, built using After Effects, expressions, and javascript with five connected files, and multiple procedural noise patterns, with the capability to use the variables that come from the Hash numbers to generate each piece of unique art."
