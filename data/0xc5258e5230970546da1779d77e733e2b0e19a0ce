  "description": "The Daft Droids have watched the defi world evolve since 1997 from their perch far out in space.\n\nThey have attempted to communicate with us, to give us financial advice, but their language was mostly confused by humans as catchy electronic music.\n\nWith the advent of blockchain based PFP collections, the Droids saw their chance to talk to humans directly using the only means we truly understand... money.\n\n4000 Daft Droids will make their earthly home on the Ethereum network, teleporting in from planet 0x0000 in the form of ERC-721 tokens.\n\nEach Droid arrives made up of randomly generated traits, including some words and symbols they hope will help them fit in on our planet.\n\nThe Droids are here to create the decentralized financial systems that humans should have created, if we weren't so obsessed with our current \"dog-based\" defi world.\n\nGenesis collection from METAVAULT"
