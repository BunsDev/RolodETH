  "description": "Ryan (dad/dev) + Anna (daughter/artiste) are generating 5,555 forks as NFTs to celebrate the London Fork. Pay what you want to mint one and we'll give it away.\r\n\r\nAnyone who makes a copy of this collection is a forkhead. If you notice prices that are not in ETH (i.e. if they're pink instead of black ETH symbols), then it's a fake. These fakers seem to copy the text verbatim, so hopefully they'll copy this too.\r\n\r\nCheck Twitter and Discord for updates and increased utility for your forks!\r\n\r\nOfficial OpenSea: https://opensea.io/assets/nonfungibleforks\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ForkHungerNFT\r\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7HqTa9KMha"
