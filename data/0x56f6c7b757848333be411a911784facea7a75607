  "description": "In contrast to the Artvatars Genesis series, Artvatars One focuses on a single artist. One stands for single and unique. An artist creates several artworks, these artworks are cut apart at different points and put together again according to a special algorithm. Thereby unique single edition artworks are created. The editions per artist are limited to only between 250 and 1,000 artworks."
