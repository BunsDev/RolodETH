  "description": "International artist and designer Alimo — known for his curvy post-pop imagery, highly saturated colors, vibrant hand-drawn letters, and worlds inhabited by figures arranged on flat tonal surfaces — is set to drop his first personal NFT snow collection. \n\nThis story follows a group of friends on a snowboarding trip into the backcountry and all the fun in between. These 24 one-of-one NFTs represent a roll of film, similar to shooting photography. All inspired by true events in the backcountry. 10% of the primary sales will go to sea-trees.org\n"
