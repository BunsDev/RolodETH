  "description": "This is the ERC-1155 Contract Collection for ANTI-POP Editions by Jake Zelinger. Anti-Pop is Zelinger's outlet for pure artistic expression while doubling as his \"R&D\" area where he experiments with programmable NFTs, Dynamic NFTs, generative projects and more. \n\n\nThese offer no utility at this time and are not related to the Steve collections or drops related to the Steve collections. \n\nANTI-POP 1/1's: https://opensea.io/collection/anti-pop"
