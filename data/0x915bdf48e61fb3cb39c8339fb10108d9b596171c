  "description": "In collaboration with 10x New York Times best-selling author Neil Strauss, $LIT presents #1 in a series of exclusive experiences for holders. Survive All Apocalypses is the first major decentralized book minted to the Ethereum blockchain. You can read this book directly from your OpenSea account by tapping to turn the page on mobile or clicking on desktop. Using a pioneering smart contract developed by Transient Labs, no longer are NFT “books” simply passes that allow you to unlock or download content. This historic book can be read directly on the NFT marketplace.\n\nOne of these NFTs will be selected at random via Chainlink VRF and the corresponding book will be updated with the copyright. What happens when a reader is the publisher?\n\nNote, to protect the other holders of the NFT book, and for other reasons to be revealed, certain rights will be reserved."
