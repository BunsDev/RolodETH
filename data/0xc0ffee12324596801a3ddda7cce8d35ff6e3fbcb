  "description": "The most recent NFT collection by Master Photographer Claudiu Guraliuc. Consists of his award-winning baroque-inspired images, his iconic Old Masters style portraiture and a few of his latest ``atypical`` experiments. Also, fans of the series will be pleased to find more of Claudiu s ``bubblegum`` images. Claudiu designed this collection as a bridge between the digital NFT space and the ``real-world``, traditional art market. Consequently, all NFTs carry the rights for a claimable limited-edition print of the work. That means the owner of the NFTs holds the rights to claim the physical artwork on the project website (fine-art.gallery). The option to claim is not a requirement and is available indefinitely until the physical artwork is claimed. Each NFT has an option to check (on the project website) whether the physical artwork has been claimed or not. The embedded artwork is signed and numbered by the artist and comes with a secured Certificate of Authenticity and proof of registration of the artwork in an international art registry. All prints are part of a limited-edition series of 1, 5 or 20. No other authenticated pieces will ever be sold by the artist or his agents. For example, for the 1/1 physical artwork, the crown jewel of the collection, both the NFT and the Real-Life work are unique and only 1 copy of each will ever exist."
