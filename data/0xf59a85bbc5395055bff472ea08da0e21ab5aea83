  "description": "Say hello to these 500 friendly little NFT fellows – whoa, not too fast! They’re scared to bits about this new world they’ve found themselves in, but that won’t stop them from facing their fears.\r\n\r\nWe didn’t want to startle them by explaining how they belong to a collection of 500 NFTs designed by 3D art guru Misoo for the Ethereum blockchain. But that’s when we realized we’ve got more to learn from them than they do from us. Scaredy Cubits know how to face their fears, and even laugh about them, and that’s what they’re here to share with all of us!\r\n\r\nA collection by @Misoo3D & @daz3d"
