  "description": "First of all, it's vanishingly rare that an NFT comes with an AI system. HDW dragons will be able to chat with its owners - Imagine how cool that is!\n\nWe also feel that there's few NFT community that features NFT-integrated online games. Each HDW dragon will have its own properties/attributes in our future games. That means your dragon is not only good for its looking, but also helps you win your game, and increase your APR in crypto mining as our plans get fully realized (this is a spoiler to our long-term plans)!\n\nHDW is a collection of 10,000 unique Hammered Dragon NFTs - unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your dragon grants you exclusive contents, including but not limited to our fun group-PVP mini games (in progress). Furthermore, your dragons also serve as the starting point of the enormous Metaverse behind-the-scene, so as the games and the Metaverse gets revealed step by step, your dragon will fly to the moon!
