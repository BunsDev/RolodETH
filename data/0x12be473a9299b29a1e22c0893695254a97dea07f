  "description": "The Blinkless: Big Bang! is a collection of planets from the Blinkless universe. The mechanics of the mint are modeled after the actual Big Bang.\n\nThe planets have a number of unique traits including resources, buried items, alien regions, weather patterns, pirate activity, and more! There are loads of rare traits to search for and collect! \n\nEach planet will be able to be split into up to 60 parcels of land each as we get closer to the launch of the immersive cartoon experience!"
