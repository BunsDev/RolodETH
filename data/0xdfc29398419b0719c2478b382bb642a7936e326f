  "description": "CHAOS #1–#501 is a collection of 501 unique digital sculptures, released as individual NFTs.\r\n\r\nCHAOS #1–#500 consist of two converging objects in motion. Each pair is made of two distinct objects that are relative in scale to one another. \r\n\r\nThe individual objects selected are engineered, cultured or manufactured by humans and sourced from the physical world and transformed into a 3D digital model.\r\n\r\nCHAOS #501 is the cumulation of all of the individual objects. In #501 all 1,000 objects from #1–#500 come together decoupled from their original pair and move independently from each other.\r\n\r\nEach NFT is composed of a reference rendering, the data to construct the work in any digital space and a set of instructions."
