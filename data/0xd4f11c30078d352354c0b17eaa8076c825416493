  "description": "The Flinch Genesis Pass is a 1111 collection that gives holders governance over the creation of the franchise, access to the creative process, airdrops of future Flinch Franchise NFTs and say over the community wallet. Holders are like the executives of the movie studio. They will be invited as VIPs to the IRL premieres, parties and events for Flinch films and media. A free mint of Flinch character NFTs will drop for the public - all Genesis Pass holders will be able to claim 1 character NFT for every pass they hold. Join the franchise."
