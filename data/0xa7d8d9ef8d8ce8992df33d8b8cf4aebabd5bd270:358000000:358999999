  "description": "*Arcadia* is a homage to the fridge-worthy landscape art of our youth. Childhood techniques of creating art are re-imagined by the scribbles of a nostalgic, computer-assisted mind.\n\n**Spacebar**: Skip animation and load final image (useful when rendering in high resolutions)\n**Up arrow**: Speed scribbles up (default speed is the highest)\n**Down arrow**: Slow scribbles down"
