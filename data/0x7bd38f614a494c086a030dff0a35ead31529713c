  "description": "Killer Acid's cartoon psychedelia drips with his signature tongue-in-cheek humor. Random, bright, and bizarre, the work draws the viewer in. Upon closer inspection, one finds they are interwoven with personal meanings and artifacts of memories. Originally launched in 2010, Killer Acid is a blend of head shop and punk rock, hearkening back to the artistâ€™s tumultuous and technicolor coming-of-age in New York City. Killer Acid entered the NFT space in 2018 on SuperRare. "
