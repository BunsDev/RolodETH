  "description": "cope. VOL 1 is a book made and self published by Aleqth, and made available to the public in October 2021. The initial release was limited to 50 hard cover copies. The pages were created on a day to day basis and I live shared the creative process of me making the book page by page on social media.  This project really had an impact on my trajectory, as the fresh style got a-lot of attention and the new work flow significantly altered my outlook and creative process. Each page, as well as the front and back cover,  have been tokenized via a sovereign contract on the blockchain."
