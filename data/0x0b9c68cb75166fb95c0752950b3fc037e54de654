  "description": "Little Beasts are Robotic Time Capsules housing creatures from magical places. Symbiotic with nature and the life force that surrounds them, they emerge from luminous corners of the world as time-travelers, storytellers, mischief-makers, and holders of memory. The collection consists of 1580 Unique Hand Drawn NFT’s created by Los Angeles based artist Johnny ’KMNDZ” Rodriguez.\r\n\r\nIn Little Beasts, Robots are joined by their animal companions to transport and protect memories to share with future generations. The collection circles back to the animistic belief that objects and creatures possess unique spiritual essence.\r\n\r\n‘KMNDZ’ is more than a moniker alluding to the ‘undo’ option on a MAC computer; it is the moniker Rodriguez’s uses for his fine art practice to reminds us we can rectify the past by focusing on the future."
