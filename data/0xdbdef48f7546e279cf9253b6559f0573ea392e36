  "description": "Distribution stats are inaccurate on OpenSea â€” read the full description for more details.\n\n1300 NFTs have been minted in phase 1, which are held by roughly 450 people (as of August 26, 2022).\nThe remaining NFTs will be minted in our upcoming phases 2, 3 and 4, over the course of the next months, and are currently held in our vault.\n\nAfter each respective mint, the NFTs will be automatically locked and non-tradable for 12 months, meaning they will not be available on OpenSea any time soon.\n\nWe will also soon allow our phase 1 minters (the only ones with freely tradable NFTs) to stake their NFTs (lock them in the smart contract) for additional utility, which will further impact the numbers shown here.\n\nThe circulating supply of vVv NFTs will remain very low for at least the next 12 months (up until September 2023)."
