  "description": "The 2222 Smurfs were transported to New York's Central Park through the whirlpool of the Blue Moon while hiding from Gargamel, where they had to return to their mushroom village before Gargamel and Azrael found them, and on the other hand, with only three apples high, they had to start their adventure in New York, the city of the Big Apple."
