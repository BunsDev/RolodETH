  "description": "Mt's redefines NFT\n\n\"The next era will be defined by today's social networking sites and the depth of connection given to users, and our job is to find the best way for users to share themselves\" - Mark Elliot Zuckerberg\nThe value of relationships is based on the sharing economy, which means sharing one's state of being, one's information, one's interests, one's hobbies. The sharing economy model will gradually extend in the crypto world and will eventually even affect the entire physical society.\n\nMt's social connections will give new value to the NFT, with social connections tied through the NFT connection, locked in once for life. When Mt's NFT is traded or transferred, the social network will also be transferred and the social connections will be permanently recorded on NFT."
