  "description": "A collection of Julia sets, mathematically connected to the [Mandelbrot Set Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/mandelbrot-set-collection) and the [Mandelbrot Trilogy Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/mandelbrot-trilogy-collection)\n\nThese artworks are generated with a numerical algorithm and engraved into 4200 unique NFTs. Each work represents the neighborhood of one of our favorite points of the Julia corresponding to the point C at the center of a piece of the Mandelbrot Set Collection. \n\nJulia's zoom factor is the logarithm of the Mandelbrot's zoom and colored with a similar gradient, based on how fast the iteration the function f(z) = z^2 + c diverges to infinity. And remember: golden-colored points are very scarce.\n\nThere are 128 video pieces realized by Abramo, plus 66 videos and 50 images created by [Maths Town](https://www.youtube.com/c/MathsTown).\n\nYou can get more information and mint a new, randomly selected Julia on [our website](https://julia.fractalnft.art)"
