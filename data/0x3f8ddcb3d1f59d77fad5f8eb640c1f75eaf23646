  "description": "The OctoMob - Welcome to the Family - https://octomob.xyz/ \n\n-Discord - https://discord.gg/bFDAKyVdwA\n \nThe Family grows together, works together, and most importantly eats together. Respects will always be paid, & the ones who came before us must never be forgotten. As we continue to build out our community of DeFi All-stars, we continue to focus on our defining principles - Trust, Transparency, Loyalty & above all else, Family. If we are going to make it, we are going to make it together. That's no reflection on any individual, it's just the way it is.\n\nOctomob has been building deep roots throughout web3. Conquered its surroundings and expanded the core members. Partnered with @Balance_Capital & @LiqdNFT to provide liquidity to our community and to capture value for both communities while bridging the gap between NFT's & Defi.\n\n"
