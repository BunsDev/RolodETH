  "description": "Each sunrise starts a new story. Every story has its own emotions, its light that needs to be captured. I traveled to Mongolia to capture those stories that were left for me by my ancestors. To find myself I went far north, above the mountains, below the clouds. Finding the people that living with their heritages. Finding places that accept them and nurture them. I captured the relationship between people and land, but in each photograph I take, the line is blurred. I started to see them as one. There was no line between them, there were only stories, the stories that needs to be told. This time I will be telling those stories, and this is my Mongolia."
