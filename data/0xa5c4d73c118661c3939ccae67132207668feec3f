  "description": "Batang ETH, also known as BETH, is a project initiated to showcase Filipino culture through the art of NFT. The project's name was derived from the Filipino word \"bata,\" which means \"kid,\" and ETH from the short form of Ethereum â€” a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Its first collection supply consists of 5000 generative Batang ETH NFT that are drawn by the inspiration of the great artwork of Azuki. Moreover, the project aims to give children with cancer in the Philippines the help, hope, and heart to live."
