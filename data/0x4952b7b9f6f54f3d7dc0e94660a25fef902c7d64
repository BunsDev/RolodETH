  "description": "MINT YOURS HERE:\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/slotter-house\n\nNostaLex is a collection of 250 1/1 hand-drawn pieces made by artist Coinslot. The body of work consist of Coinslotâ€™s main character Lex the Copy Cat inspired by cartoons, movies from the early 90s, as well as Childhood memories.\n\nThe goal of this project is to share the body of work and to reinvest into bigger art projects, the overall Coinslot brand, and to provide as much utility as possible such as physical goods, discounts, and private events to the Coinslot community.\n\nI invite you to take a trip with me down memory lane as we uncover memories you may have forgotten growing up. I hope you enjoy this collection as much as I enjoyed creating it.\n\n- Coinslot"
