  "description": "Grimes, a multi-hyphenate artist, is well known for her music and visual language. She has taken form as a simulation combining gamer fantasy, anime and manga, science fiction, apocalyptic omens, and anachronistic fashion among other genres. Her most recent series of artwork, WarNymph, is realized with her collaborator, Mac Boucher.\r\n\r\nWarNymph is the Goddess of Neo-Genesis. She battles the destructive force of obsolete ideas and systemic decay that threatens the future. She embodies the power of perpetual regeneration that manifests in a state of infinite infancy where she sheds her old skin of corruption."
