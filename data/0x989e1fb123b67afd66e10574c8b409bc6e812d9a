  "description": "Drakons is a strategy game where you get to collect and play elemental dragon non-fungible tokens or NFTs called DRAKONS in the Ethereum Blockchain and Polygon Network (Matic) sidechain. Drakon Masters will get to enjoy battles in Drakon Arenas for a chance to play-to-earn loots, boosts and valuable gems that can be exchanged to Drakons’ utility token called Drakoins or $DRK.  #BeADrakonMaster"
