  "description": "AVAILABLE ON FND\nhttps://foundation.app/collection/spiag\nA Collection entirely shot on expired film, about a one-of-a-kind beach in the Gulf of Naples, Italy.\nThis beach used to be the greatest port in Italy more than 2500 years ago (512 BC). Nowadays itâ€™s a block of concrete where the locals are burning their skins all day during the summer. With a direct view of Capri Island, and a calm and warm Mediterranean Sea this place seems peaceful and out of time. "
