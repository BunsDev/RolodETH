  "description": "Coming elements are a symbol of the development narrative of ComingChat. It is the unique NFT culture of ComingChat. Every major iteration of ComingChat will have a corresponding Coming Element born. It is presented in the form of NFT. Each individual Coming Element consists of ComingChat version number, version upgrade information, element name, and Element attributes. The idea of elements is coming from the elements in the periodic table, starting with Hydrogen (symbol H) corresponding to each iteration of ComingChat in order. "
