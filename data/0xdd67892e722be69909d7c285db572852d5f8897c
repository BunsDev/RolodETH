(Last updated: July 18th)\n\nScholarz is a collection of ERC721 tokens based on ethereum blockchain. Currently, the Scholarz universe is known to be inhabited by 2 races, aliens and humanoids. They look quite different. Despite their trait differences, they are actually two peas in a pod. They both love two things: learning and playing. Why? It makes them smarter and more experienced. Legend also said that these Scholarz are still trying to discover their long lost companions. With each passing day, they grow smarter, it is possible that they might find them. Who knows? Only way to find out is by adopting these cute little Scholarz!"
