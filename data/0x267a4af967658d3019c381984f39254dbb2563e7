  "description": "200 Lost Kids Living on Ethereum\n\nForced by their mothers to run away, for reasons they could not understand, The Lost Kids formed a bond to look out for one another, as they struggled to survive on their own.\n\nRunning scared was all The Lost Kids knew, so when they crashed onto an alien planet, they did not know how to respond to the gentle and nurturing attention from the female inhabitants."
