  "description": "JENISU is a crypto pop artist based in Tokyo. She aims to reinvent the mundane reality into a more vibrant, ideal world that she envisions. Her art can easily be recognized by her signature vivid color palette, detailed outlines and the unique way she reinterprets everyday subject matter. Themes that interest her the most are retro aesthetics, technology, fashion, nature, and still life objects. Shortly after she began sharing her artworks online, Snapchat commissioned her to create 69 unique stickers which are still shown today to over 238 million daily active users worldwide. She was selected as one of the top 9 best pop artists on SuperRare to exhibit at the platformâ€™s own Museum of Art in Decentraland."
