  "description": "Inspired by traditional Chinese architecture and Chinese painting, this project uses algorithms to generate window lattices with different patterns and blossoms and trees with different postures. Together with the possible rain and snow scenes, they constitute a corner with oriental aesthetic charm. These scenes are dynamic, such as slowly moving window frames, tree-growing, raining. We can imagine being indoors, watching the shaky tree shadow outside the window, or looking into the window from the same perspective as the current picture. Maybe we are looking into memories, maybe we are looking into hopes, anyone can write their own poems."
