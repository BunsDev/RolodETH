  "description": "AZAR, the [mxtter](https://mxtter.art/) genesis collection, is inspired by the \"test prints\" of screen printing. Screenprints are created one color, one layer at a time. Typically, artists or printers test each layer before starting the print run, using pages from previous prints or misprinted paper. These sheets slowly gather more layers of color and artworks from different artists."
