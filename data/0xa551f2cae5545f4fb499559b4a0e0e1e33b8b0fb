  "description": "After a year of high anticipation, Kim Rose has finally released “Sydney,” her genesis NFT. “Sydney” represents Kim’s foray into the NFT world, and in keeping with her creative tradition, is inspired by a geographic location. This piece takes Kim’s usual inspiration one step further and actually mimics the weather of Sydney, Australia. For example, on a sunny day, “Sydney” appears bright and scenic. On a stormy night, however, “Sydney” appears dark and brooding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough years of Kim’s artistic mastery, she’s taken interest in the poetic movement of her wet inks. Kim worked diligently to harness this organic flow and layer them in digital seamless loops, crafting the perfect marriage of movement and meditation for her principal NFT. “Sydney” is just the beginning for Kim Rose and her body of work: the mesmerizing and grounding nature of her physical pieces has entered the digital world to usher in a new era of Kim Rose Art."
