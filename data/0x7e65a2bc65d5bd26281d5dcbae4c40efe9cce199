  "description": "Seasons. \n\nWe go through many seasons during our lives that can be defined on the calendar; stages of development; career and personal growth. This typography work I did years ago represents Life and a favorite quote of mine: “There is no normal life, there’s just life.” We each face our own challenges and seasons we go through. It is just part of life. We all deal with things differently, and how we handle these things and the outlook we chose affects us. \n\nThe collection is composed of a total of 15 individual pieces, 12 of which represent the 4 seasons. The monochrome set symbolizes the entirety of life. \n\nMix and match your set. \n\nBuy the complete set. \n\nMake any derivatives that come to mind. Let me know what you create! CC0.\n\nWhatever you do, I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nHave a great year and enjoy your seasons, great and small. It’s all part of Life.\n\nNow everyone has a chance at owning my genesis collection.\n\n-NorCal Guy"
