  "description": "Love is Love is an art experiment in self-identification and expression of love powered by the idea of being able to influence your art. We all love finding meaning in art and while every artist hopes their art speaks to the individual in a way unique to them, why not let the individual be part of the creation process?\r\n\r\nThis is not a 10k project, it is not a pfp project. This is a journey into an art gallery where you get to pick what is displayed on the walls.\r\n\r\nNo roadmap. No utility. Just art.\r\n\r\nwww.loveislove.io\r\n#LoveisLoveNFT"
