  "description": "Clash of Streamers has fully moved to Polygon. This means all your old tokens (PRPS, DUBI) and NFT's have been replicated (forked) on Polygon. You still own them on the same address, just on Polygon instead of Ethereum. This collection is the old Ethereum version which is now deprecated and no longer officially used.\n\nClash of Streamers is a fully free-to-play mobile RPG which allows players to export heroes and pets to the blockchain. Clash of Streamers Pets can be bred together to create even rarer pets, as well as rented to other players for the ERC20 token DUBI."
