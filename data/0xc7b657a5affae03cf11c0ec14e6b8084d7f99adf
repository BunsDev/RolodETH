  "description": "What does the word 'phantom' suggest to you? Probably a white figure, perhaps draped, masked or otherwise obscured. Yet no genuine photograph of a phantom has ever been taken, and most of us cannot point to any particular origin of these characteristics. Thus `phantom' is an emergent concept, a product of culture. If we accept that some observers have seen phantoms, in their mind's eye or otherwise, then somewhere in the space of possibilities lay true pictures of phantoms.\n\nEach Phantom is a fully-periodic 6s film, generated from scratch in p5.js. Most are rendered naturalistically; others appear as they might in a dream, a nightmare, or a psychedelic hallucination.\n\nOther collections by EDG:\n\n[alien tongues](https://opensea.io/collection/alientongues) | [alien codex](https://opensea.io/collection/aliencodex) | [spectral beings](https://opensea.io/collection/spectral-beings-official)"
