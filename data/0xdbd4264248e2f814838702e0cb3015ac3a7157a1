  "description": "TradeSquads is an Ethereum based collectible game developed with care by the NFT Trader team. Because we love everything about NFTs and want to create some fun around them, the team has developed this unique decentralized game. Our goal by adding this gamification system is to extend the potential of the Trade Squads NFTs with added utility for the future.\n\nAs a tribute to blockchain technology and the P2P protocol on which NFT Trader is based, this batch will take the name as the â€œAtomic Collection.\"\n\nThe key fascinating feature for this collection is represented by the element for their randomness. Each NFT belonging to this collection will be mintable and can take on a set of characteristics that will make it truly unique and therefore increase its intrinsic value.\n\nThe NFT Trader team will also not know the nature of each NFT Trade Squads that will be generated. They're mintable here: https://www.nfttrader.io/tradesquads/marketplace/mint"
