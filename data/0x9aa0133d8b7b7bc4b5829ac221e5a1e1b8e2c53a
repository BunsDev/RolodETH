  "description": "A smattering of colour and noisy distortion creates visually striking pieces, where order is commanded from simple chaos. Read between the lines and you'll understand that there is more than meets the eye.\n\nThis series of 1000 generative art pieces is an homage to the audio-visual technology of yester-year.\n\nAll editions are secured on a dedicated IPFS gateway. Meaning that your purchase is safe from centralized entities. So when you purchase a Cathode, you OWN a Cathode."
