  "description": "PA:SYI_ is the 10,000 PFP expansion to the Project Atmos metaverse exploring the concept of identity.\n\nPFPs play a dominant role in our society. It tells the world what we like, what we donâ€™t like, and defines who we are and who we aspire to be.\nPFPs are our online identity.\n\nPA:SYI_ is an exploration of this connection between an individual and their online persona. We set out to explore these intricacies but instead of using recognizable faces, and recognizable traits (3D glasses, anything gold) we used elements that represented feelings and interests in a more natural way. Rising sun, misty evening, a lonely road; when combined, these elements become your story, your identity."
