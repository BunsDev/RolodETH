  "description": "The first 5,000 Citizenz will be the Genesis Citizenz. These will be your key to Citizenz City. Genesis Citizenz will have access to the most Utility Benefits, and will have exclusive perks in the future as we progress through our Roadmap. Petz, Breeding, Land, and Governance are just a fraction of what Genesis Holders will have access to. \n\n - Website: https://citizenznft.io/#\n - Discord: https://www.discord.gg/CitizenzNFT\n - Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/CitizenzNFT\n\nGenesis Citizenz will also be staked to earn Citizenz Coin. Citizenz Coin is our Utility Token that is solely created for the use of minting more NFTs in the Citizenz Ecosystem. Citizenz Coin has no other functionality other than within the Citizenz ecosystem and nothing else."
