  "description": "A complete stealth launch. No website. No marketing. Just three friends and a contract. Originally a 1250 collection at 0.06Îž. We never minted out. \n\nWe capped the collection and kept building. Only 307 Ponzi Rugs exist; the rest of the collection is lost until the end of time. \n\nOur collection is special because it is 100% stored and generated on the Ethereum blockchain. No IPFS. No API. Ponzi Rugs are designed to be perfect for your Discord and Twitter banner.\n\nOwnership of a rug grants you access to exclusive giveaways and other surprising pleasures. They are also essential for our [V2 Project](https://medium.com/@KingpinNFTs/ponzi-rugs-v2-the-pull-theory-cb04b1b461c7).\n\nCome get rugged."
