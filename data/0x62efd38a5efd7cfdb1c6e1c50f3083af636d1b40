  "description": "Outlaw Gals Motorcycle Club is a collection of 6000 absolutely kickass Female Biker NFTs that were created with love and care by Katherine Swampmaid. Culturally diversified, unique in appearance, remarkably expressive, Outlaw Gals are a symbol of women empowerment in NFT space. \nTo date OGMC has donated over 20 ETH to charities and organizations (incl. 2Young2Wed and Free The Girls) that fight for women rights around the world. OGMC augments the roadmap on the fly, dropping art and overdelivering on the promises. With upcoming Free 3D motorcycle drop for all Gal holders in Q1 2022, OGMC will transition from Roadmap 1.0 to Roadmap 2.0.\nhttps://ogmc.io"
