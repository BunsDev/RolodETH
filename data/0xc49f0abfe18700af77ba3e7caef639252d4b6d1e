  "description": "Inspired by the news of the day, I started this adventure in Midjourney with the prompt \"The Queen Is Dead.\" I continue to be fascinated bu how these ai generated images can be so evocative and make the viewer feel things right away. As explored variation rabbit holes I was amazed by the nightmares materializing in front of me. Some of the results I fed back into DALL-E for added ai manipulation, in others I decided the Dead Queen needed an army. Finally I took the results into photoshop for some final hand touching. These pieces are terrifying to me, what they are, where they came from, and what they represent. And now I'm sharing them with you."
