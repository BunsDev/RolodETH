  "description": "Shroomies are a collection of 100 limited edition NFTs, all starring Ines Helene (Aka- ShroomGirl). Every card owner will be welcomed into a private club, where members can chat with Ines, trade cards, help create season 2 and view exclusive content (not even on OnlyFans!) plus more secret perks...\n\nEvery Shroomie has 3 traits:\n\n- A character (13 total): Shroomgirl, Harems X Ines Helene, Queen of Hearts, Dominatrix, Bank Robber, Catwoman, Above The Clouds, Deal With The Devil, F**k The Police, Guantanamo Bae, Bunny X Psilocybin, French Maid and Burlesque.\n- A shininess (3 total): Classic (75%), Gold (20%) and Rainbow (5%).\n- An accent colour (11 total): White, Black, Red, Blue, Yellow, Purple, Green, Orange, Pink, Lime and Cyan.\n\nThe rarity score tells you how common that character is, so a card marked with \"1/1\" is the only one of that character, while a card marked with \"1/10\" is more common!
