  "description": "The Meta Organization is a private metaverse community. 1000 Access Cards were originally sold, granting buyers a lifetime pass into The Meta Organization. High-valued investors, enthusiasts, artists, and beginners are all connected through the form of one NFT. Members receive free access to The Meta Organization's exclusive airdrops, private events, and collaboration releases as long as they hold their Access Card. \n\nThe only way to obtain entry into The Meta Organization once entirely sold out is by purchasing an Access Card on the secondary markets.\n"
