  "description": "The Crazy Crows Chess Club is a collection of fun flying crows that come with a ton of utility.  Each crow grants you a chance to win gold membership on chess.com, where the community holds weekly tournaments for prizes, plus entry into community games like puzzles and treasure hunts!\n\nIf you are feeling wicked, you can put two crows into the Mad House, our burning mechanism, to combine them for increased rarity!"
