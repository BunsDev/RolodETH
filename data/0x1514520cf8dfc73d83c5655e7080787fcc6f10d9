  "description": "Dave Pollot is NY based artist and former software engineer known for his seamless addition of contemporary life/pop culture icons into traditional backgrounds (most often using oil paints and found/thrifted paintings). What initially began as a joke between him and his wife in 2012 quickly became a desire to answer a question: Could he change the meaning of an unwanted piece of artwork without drastically altering its aesthetic and make it wanted again? Since that time heâ€™s completed hundreds of paintings and his work has been displayed and found in homes, galleries, businesses, and private collections in all 50 states and in over 40 countries around the world. His work has attracted attention from the media both in the U.S. and abroad, including Business Insider, Instagram, Hypebeast, HiFructose, the SyFy Channel, and more. His corporate clients include SONY, Instagram, McDonalds, New Balance, and others."
