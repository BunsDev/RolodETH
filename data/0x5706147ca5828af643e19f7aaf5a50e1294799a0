  "description": "On a damp fall morning, a doodle was taking a stroll in the misty woods. As he came over a hill, he noticed something glowing in the distance.\r\n\r\nAs he got closer, an audible hum began to permeate his mind. There they were. The most beautiful mushrooms heâ€™d ever laid eyes on. Too beautiful not to eat. So he did, and was immediately thrust into the world of Superlative Doodles. A pastel world of fractal psychedelia.\r\n\r\nSuperlative Doodles is a family project, created by artist Mimi and marketing consultant Andrea, who happen to be brother and sister. There will only be 3000 pieces minted in this collection. These gorgeous pieces are trippy, fantastical, and mind-bending. Get yours to be part of a new colorful family."
