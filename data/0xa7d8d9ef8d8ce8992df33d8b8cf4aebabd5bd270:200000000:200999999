  "description": "Flowing in life, overwhelmed by colors. Staying afloat, one step at a time, in a sea of details. When dancing in a storm of changes, pause for a second. Too much of a good thing, is still too much. Take a step back, breath, and thank the universe.\n\nPrice gets halved every 30 minutes until resting price of .555 ETH\n2.22 -> 1.11 -> .555"
