  "description": "Morphys are 10k unique 1920s cartoon characters which can change their appearance & traits on chain. When a new season begins, the owner can decide whether or not his Morphy shall morph into its new seasonal appearance. The morphing changes its appearance and its traits, kinda like putting a costume on your Flowtys. This results in the community of holders collectively deciding which traits become the rarest over time."
