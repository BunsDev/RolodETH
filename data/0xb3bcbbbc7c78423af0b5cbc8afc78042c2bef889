  "description": "Modeled after a Japanese lucky cat, 14,159 Manekis were programmatically generated by a random combination of hundreds of traits. These beautiful artworks live on the Ethereum blockchain in form of ERC-721 tokens. Your Lucky Maneki acts as a governance token, so you can vote on the future direction of the project and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to the Challenges.  Visit [luckymaneki.com](https://luckymaneki.org/) for more details."
