  "description": "The Fast Food Lil Baby Ape Club are a collection of 2,000 unique Fast Food themed baby apes. This project was inspired to combat a growing trend of NFT projects having racist roots as well supporting anti-racism education and charities.  Ownership provides access to supporting an ever-evolving form of reducing and eliminating racism that is decided by holders, as well as unique experiences that can only be entered by owning one of the 2000 Apes in the collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT affiliated with LBAC or any organization."
