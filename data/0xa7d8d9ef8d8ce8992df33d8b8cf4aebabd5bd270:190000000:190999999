  "description": "Mental Pathways is a graphical representation of our thoughts. As our thoughts, each trail needs to follow a path from one point to another in order to complete itself and arrive at its final solution or understanding. Sometimes the road can be short and simple, other long and complex, or even made up of different thoughts and afterthoughts. Colors are the sensations we experience while we think and each can mean different things: a state of mind, a feeling, a problem to be solved.\nDutch auction starting at 0.6Ξ ending 0.25Ξ reduced every 5 minutes: 0.6 / 0.45 / 0.35 / 0.25"
