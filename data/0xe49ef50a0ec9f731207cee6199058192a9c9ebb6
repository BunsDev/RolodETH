  "description": "Professor Elon Rocket Factory is a collection of 9,999 unique NFTs on the Ethereum (ERC-721) blockchain. Each one is unique, thoughtfully designed and picked by Professor Elon himself. He is the most versatile man in the world who knows Everything. The Magellan of the future who will take us to the end of the universe and into the distant future. The works we produce try to present a parody. Completely satire, parody, meme and pop art. So with this said, our dear lord Elon will lead us the right way. Whether it be the Moon or Mars, or even the farthest star. No matter where we go, we know that Papa Elon won't be far. So with our fellow Doge companion by our side, strap in, as this is going to be a wild ride!"
