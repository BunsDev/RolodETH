  "description": "Ghost in the Machine is an exclusive release airdrop to collectors of AIIV, an AI art collaboration by Ravi Vora and Phil Bosua.\n\n291 AI-generated 1/1 artworks exploring otherworldly entities through the eyes of artificial intelligence.\n\nEach piece is a vision of what AI thinks a ghost in the machine looks like. Maybe AI sees the ghosts we do not? Maybe the ghost in the machine is AI? Maybe it’s both?\n\nThe concept of life, death, and the afterlife would be very different to an AI. If AI truly is a window into other dimensions, it’s possible in time we may also experience imagination like the AI - on an infinite scale.\n\nLet your imagination lead you to your Ghost. The cute ones are rare!\n\nGhost in the Machine Collection - concept and art by Phil Bosua\n\nAIIV is part of the AIM Collective"
