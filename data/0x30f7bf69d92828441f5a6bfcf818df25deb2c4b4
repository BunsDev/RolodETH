  "description": "NFTs that take up whole blocks, so that you can \"own\" a block, \nthe blocks have pretty numbers and we bring top artists to illustrate em\n\n-- The current images are just pre-reveils which will be updated into new pre-reveils soon\n         and at a later stage we'll get a dope artist to do the actual block --"
