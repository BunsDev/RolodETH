  "description": "_See_ [Why We’re Auctioning an NFT of Our 2005 YouTube Memo](https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/why-were-auctioning-an-nft-of-our-2005-youtube-memo-a53099b2ae89)\n\nThe YouTube Memo NFT is a chance to own a piece of internet history, for a good cause. This 2005 seed stage investment memo is a time capsule from the advent of Web 2.0, so it seemed fitting to auction it at the precipice of Web 3.0. And it’s a reminder of how new technologies can scale more than we can imagine, try as we might. Proceeds will go to OxPARC’s public ecosystem fund, which will distribute them in a manner they deem maximally beneficial to the crypto community."
