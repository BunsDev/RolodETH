  "description": "Cai Guo-Qiang created a special sketch for his NFT project *[Your Daytime Fireworks](https://opensea.io/collection/trlab-your-daytime-fireworks)*. The twelve different daytime fireworks depicted in the sketch correspond to the twelve countries in which digital fireworks are “launched” over the course of this project. **Cai transformed the creation process of the sketch into a commemorative NFT entitled *Imagine This*.**\n\nSketches have always been an important artistic means for Cai to explore his inspirations and run through his creative process. Through the special work *Imagine This*, Cai looks forward to sharing more about the creation process that is often opaque to the public and thanking the community for their continuous support.\n\nThe launch of *Imagine This* was announced on May 4, 2022, coinciding with the 12th anniversary of Cai's solo and inaugural exhibition *Peasant Da Vinci* at the Rockbund Art Museum in Shanghai. This small work also commemorates the friendship between TRLab co-founder and CEO Audrey Ou, the museum’s founders, and Cai Guo-Qiang."
