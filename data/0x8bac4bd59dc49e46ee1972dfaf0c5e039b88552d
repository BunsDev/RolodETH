  "description": "Luminal Genesis is, at heart, a passion project by nprussell. It's a collection of 444 alien worlds generated by AI and modified/improved by artist. The original aim was to create one of the most consistent and respectable collections of AI art in the NFT space. \nLuminal Genesis is far more than that, now. A Luminal Genesis NFT is a ticket/key to everything that follows, and will be used in all future utility to some extent. You can of course be part of the Luminal Community and join in with everything to follow without holding a Genesis, but Genesis holders will always benefit from the wider project as it grows. \n\nSome benefits to Genesis holders (please note, this list is not absolute and will 100% grow over time):\n\nFree mint to Luminal Universe (1 mint per Genesis NFT owned)\nFree mint to all of nprussell's future work (already started with AI Everyday)\nExclusive whitelist and prize giveaways\n"
