  "description": "The Planet of the Frapes is in danger. Our once beautiful home is now decimated by an invasive microorganism that feeds on our planet’s vegetation. This invasion has led to an atmospheric imbalance and our oxygen levels are quickly depleting.\n\nWe have sent multiple transmissions to Earth, a planet inhabited by degenerates that has conditions suitable for the Frapes’ survival. There are 6,666 Frapes in need of rescue. Please, degenerates, if you hear our call, we need your help to save our species!"
