  "description": "The second collection from Bitlectro Labs, Dreamers feature 16-bit art and music by STRFKR member Keil Corcoran with musical contributions from Arian Jalali also of the band STRFKR. Dreamers holders will receive a free Sandbox VX version of their avatar launching soon.  Dreamers will be integrated into the upcoming Dreamlands Battle Arena coming in 2022. Dreamers are minted in a 'cryostasis' state like a pack of collectible cards or a gift, with their metadata kept secret until they are 'unfrozen' using our dashboard at bitlectrolabs.com. The owner of each Dreamer receives a Creative Commons CC BY license for their musical and visual composition to use as they see fit.  Unfreeze your Dreamers at https://bitlectrolabs.com."
