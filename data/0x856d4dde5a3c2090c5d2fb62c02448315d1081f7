  "description": "This edition is a charity project whose proceeds are used to purchase and transport essential items for the people of Ukraine. \n\nI have a very deep connection to this Chernobyl exclusion zone. Not only because I could always enjoy the peace and quiet there. Not only because I love to explore the past. But mainly because my interest in the Chernobyl exclusion zone has tied me very closely to Ukraine and its wonderful people. \n\nToday I don't know if I will ever see this place again. Whether I will ever see the friends I made there again. Because where I once found peace and tranquillity, there are now tanks and soldiers. And my peaceful and friendly buddy is fighting them with Molotov cocktails. For his freedom, for the freedom of Ukraine and for our freedom.\n\nI want to support these brave people. I owe them that.\n\nSLAVA UKRAINI"
