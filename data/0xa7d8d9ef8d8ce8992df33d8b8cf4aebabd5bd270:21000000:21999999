  "description": "The essence of all things digital is– the bit. One or Zero. On or Off. Where digital becomes analog. This piece pays tribute to our digital legacy of 8-bit color and 7-segment LED displays– technological limitations which are mirrored in the constraints of putting art on the blockchain. Although the image represents the art, the art of the token itself is the code– which renders everything bitwise, pixel by pixel, all contained within 27-bits of information."
