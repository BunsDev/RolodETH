You can think of ISO50 as an operating system and Tycho as a product of the process design within that system. His portfolio - iso50.com - offers a lens into the past, present and future of TYCHO : ISO50.

His first NFT collection - Element - showcases his multifaceted ability to channel memories and environments through unreleased musical compositions and animations. Tycho has twice received Grammy nominations for Best Dance/Electronic album while under the ISO50 moniker has received many accolades including the FWA award.
