Card benefits will soon expand to other platforms, real-world events, items, & industries.\r\nOGs are the most powerful cards, with art from top-tier artists in addition to \"Accidental Collaboration\" artwork. These cards hold at least 3 Limited Trait slots in addition to random & conditional Traits. OGs are likely to receive the most powerful versions of special Traits.\r\nAlphas are powerful cards with similar art to OGs, holding at least 2 Limited Trait slots in addition to random & conditional Traits, & have a high chance to receive powerful special Traits.\r\nFounders have “Accidental Collaboration” artwork. These cards hold at least 1 Limited Trait slot in addition to any random & conditional Traits, with a chance to receive powerful special Traits."
