  "description": "Cro, one of Germany's leading rap artists, pursues another artistic expression besides music: he creates works of art under his aka \"Carlito\". Carlito's motifs are contemporary, some figurative, some abstract, always with a fine stroke and a strong, personal expression. In March, award-winning artist Cro and Timeless tokenised the world's first artwork created for fractionalisation, \"Michelle\". \n\nOver 400 fans own shares in the artwork, which sold out within minutes. Two weeks after the initial drop on the platform, a big reveal followed: the painting does not only feature a beautiful front side – it also has a unique reverse side. And now, Cro and Timeless are dropping NFT PAPs (Profile Art Picture) with 1.000 interpretations of Michelle.\n\nBy clicking on the “Buy now” button you accept the 'Terms of Sale - Carlito Collection' and 'AGB Carlito Collection' on https://cro.timeless.investments/."
