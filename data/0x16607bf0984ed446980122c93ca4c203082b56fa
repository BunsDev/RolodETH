  "description": "Reserve Dollar (RSD) is a community NFT project. Our mission is to create Reserve Protocol inspired NFT artwork and give back to the community via RSR airdrops. \n\nSeason 1 features members of the Reserve Protocol team on futuristic bank notes. Weekly RSR airdrops will be delivered to randomly selected RSD holders. The more RSD you hold, the more likely you are to receive an airdrop. RSD can be purchased or traded via the Reserve Dollar storefront on OpenSea."
