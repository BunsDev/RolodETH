  "description": "“Squares” utilizes the shape of a square as a unit of construction, combining and overlapping them at various scales to create interplays of color, structure, and atmosphere. The overall effect is something along the lines of Bauhaus meets Blade Runner, as complex rectilinear forms float untethered through fields of light and texture."
