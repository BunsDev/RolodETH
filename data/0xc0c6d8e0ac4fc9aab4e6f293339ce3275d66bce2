  "description": "Consisting of an interactive video and generative still images, Modulator One is an experiment in collaboratively authoring a past moment. \n\nEach image acts as a different recollection of the same moment under alternate conditions of lighting through photographic technology called platelight.\n\nThe still images are generated upon being collected, co-authored by the unique fingerprint of a collectors wallet.\n\nThe interactive video is a record of this moment of creation, yet is changeable through interaction. \n\nThese are the first dynamically generated photographic NFTs and the first interactive lighting video and NFT of its kind.\n\nIâ€™ve found photographic technology to be an amazing tool to play with the way in which we deal with the past. As we create our identities, myths, histories and stories we use the past in a plastic, changeable way. My goal with this project is to present a past moment and experience its mutable nature collaboratively.\n\nhttp://www.vanderoer.com/modulator\n"
