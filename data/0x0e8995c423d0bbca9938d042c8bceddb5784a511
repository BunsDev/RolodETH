  "description": "Block of Horror is re-envisioning film, media, and storytelling from a decentralized, community-based perspective. The Prologue collection welcomes holders into Block of Horrorâ€™s **Inner Circle**, where creative and communal decisions are made in the development of original IP. Exclusive access, licensing opportunities, and fan empowerment are all core elements within Block of Horror, and these 750 NFTs represent our most inspired, dedicated and visionary members - our **Prophets**.\n\nBlock of Horror: Season 1 kicks off with our Genesis collection later this year, filled with 13 original movie-worthy stories, created with the community while challenging the choke points of Hollywood gatekeeping, shared commercialization rights, and recycled cookie-cutter content.\nVisit www.blockofhorror.com for more, and welcome to the Block."
