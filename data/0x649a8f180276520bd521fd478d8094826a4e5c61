  "description": "Ikusa is a WEB3 streetwear brand inspired by anime and high-fashion Japanese aesthetics. Actual, measurable, and authentic liquid advantages are the finest way to feel real worth. The benefits of shared ownership, transparency, and privacy, community as well as the enjoyment of those benefits, are at the heart of Web3. \n\nIkusa's model is straightforward. Limited-edition streetwear offered to an unrestricted audience at specific times and in limited quantities. Only accepting payments through the WEB3 gateway, which encourages more engagement from WEB2 and draws visitors into the tunnel that connects WEB3 and WEB2. Their designs will never be duplicated, and WEB3 technology will be used to verify authenticity."
