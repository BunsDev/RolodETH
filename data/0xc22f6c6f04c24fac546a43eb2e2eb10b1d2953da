  "description": "Cryptopunks had a bug in their first contract and so did we…there is no such thing as a coincidence. This contract is retired, go check out the new genesis collection at https://opensea.io/collection/the-colors-dot-art\n\nThe Colors Legacy are a set of 4,317 iconic shades generated and stored entirely on-chain to be used as a primitive and for color field vibes. ~ A Color is Forever ∞\n\n⚠ Disclaimer: This is the legacy colors contract, an artifact of time. These colors are not original The Colors and do not qualify as originals for future purposes."
