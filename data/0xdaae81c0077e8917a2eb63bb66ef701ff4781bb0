  "description": "PepeDapp Remint is a community-owned, transparent airdrop to holders of the original [PepeDapp](https://www.pepedapp.io/) collectible. The original PepeDapp wasn't written to be ERC721 or ERC1155 compliant and the new wrapper contract is ERC1155 compliant, making it tradeable on OpenSea, Rarible, etc. \n\nPepeDapp Remint is run by members of the original PepeDapp community.\n\nA full snapshot of ownership was taken at Ethereum block 11075000 (see [here](https://github.com/wrapped-pepes/airdrop/blob/main/sql/events.sql)) for the specific query.\n\nThis is a completely fair, no-fee airdrop. Just visit the [claim UI](https://wrapped-pepes.onrender.com/) and you can claim any cards you owned at block 11075000."
