  "description": "_100 PRINT_ is a nonfigurative, abstract generative drawing system based on the principles of visual perspective. Each edition is made up of carefully constructed lines and shapes that fit into a multidimensional world created on the fly, inviting the viewer to let their eyes wander and find pockets of what appear to be deliberately constructed objects in 3D space. _100 PRINT_ is an experimental project that draws inspiration from a wide variety of sources, including cubist and abstract expressionist artworks, printer test sheets, and Escher sketches. It represents a raw display of powerful drawing principles that have governed the construction of many artworks before it."
