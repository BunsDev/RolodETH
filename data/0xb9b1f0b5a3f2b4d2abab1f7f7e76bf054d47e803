  "description": "Each bid must be 10% higher than the one before. The previous bidder will immediately receive their money back + 5% (minus gas fees). The rest is the artist's royalty. A winning bid receives an NFT in their wallet of a bubble. As soon as there is a subsequent bid, the bubble passes on to the next winner. The previous transaction will become a receipt which advertises your return.\n\nI love NFTs so I just had to make a never-ending bubble. The greater fool theory encoded as a smart contract + generative art + receipts of your financial return + humor. Always humor."
