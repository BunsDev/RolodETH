  "description": "Life is fleeting, yet it is filled with a countless amount of moments.\n\nAt times, we lose sight of the big picture, and other times we focus too much on the future and past instead of the present.\n\nAbstracts is an ongoing collection that reflect my struggles to be mindful and present. All primary collectors of this collection will be airdropped a unique 1/1 that I will create on a future trip within 12 months of purchase."
