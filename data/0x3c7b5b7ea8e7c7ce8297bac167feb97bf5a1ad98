  "description": "**Year of the Woman (YOTW)** presents a dynamic new series of Chinese Zodiac artworks created by Australian artist Yasmin Shima. Each Year of the Woman NFT is uniquely generated from 400 traits. With so many distinct features each NFT is one-of-a-kind. The main character conceptually represents each Zodiac animal using a playful amalgamation of animal and human, merging East and West.  Visit [Year of the Woman](https://www.yearofthewoman.io/)"
