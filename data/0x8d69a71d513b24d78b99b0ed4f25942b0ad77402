  "description": "The galaxy has been ransacked by an evil dictator who is forcing everyone to conform and to look the same. AwkwardAliens are the last 10,000 ERC-721 unique aliens in their galaxy who defy him, standing proud in what makes them different. The planet of Awkwardia needs your help...\n\nEvery AwkwardAlien mint and trade gets you access to a community of likeminded freedom fighters. Join our fight against the average, unlock special perks, and help mint brand new awkward allies from across the galaxy.\n\nYour awkward adventure awaits... ðŸ‘½"
