  "description": "The Rebels Seals is a community driven universe set in a fantastical world of mystery, mysticism, and cryptocurrency. Though this world is a fictional one, it is plagued with problems that you may find in the real world. Tyrannical leaders seeking to control populations, evil institutions regulating anything and everything to their own benefit, and corruption running rampant throughout the state just to name a few. Our writers, developers, designers, and illustrators inspired by the likes of Love, Death art + Robots & Tolkien's Lord of the Rings seek to enlighten the citizens of the Hodl Lands through the entertaining and light-hearted by means of the highest quality animations.
