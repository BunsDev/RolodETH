  "description": "Holders of nth Culture Mint Passes are entitled to mint an NFT from Fingacode's upcoming collection. \r\n\r\n'nth culture' takes inspiration from the textile heritage of Junior’s maternal homeland of Bamenda, Cameroon. Toghu and Ndop fabrics are rich in meaning, using a selection of motifs, colour palettes, patterns and compositions that have lineages to specific places and traditions.\r\n\r\nThis collection is a celebration of identity, abstracting interwoven narratives of textile heritage through generative coding to reflect the experience of children of the diaspora; living lives in spaces between multiple cultural worlds. nth culture explores the concept of ‘Third Culture' and reflects on the unique diversity of personal identity."
