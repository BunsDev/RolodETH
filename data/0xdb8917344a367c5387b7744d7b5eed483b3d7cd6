  "description": "The BlockPunks collection is 100% handmade and not programmatically generated. All 10,000 are 1/1 3D reconstruction of the original 10k cryptopunks made in the style of building lego blocks as a symbol of human capacity and passion.\n\nIt was started on OS (opensea.io/collection/theblockpunks-v1), the BlockPunks had great acceptance and after a while was moved to a smart contract, every OG owner got airdrop with golden background versions of their BlockPunks."
