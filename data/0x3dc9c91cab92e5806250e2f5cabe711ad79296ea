  "description": "The Pigeon Social (TPS) is a collection of 10,000 hand drawn and randomly generated flocking cool NFTs that flock around on the Ethereum Blockchain. TPS Flockers can participate in exclusive events such as NFT raffles, community giveaways, and lots more. All pigeons are flocking dope, but some are rarer than others.\n\n[Website](https://www.thepigeonsocial.com)\n\n[Honorary Pigeons](https://opensea.io/collection/the-pigeon-social-honorary)\n\n[Event Pigeons](https://opensea.io/collection/the-pigeon-social-events)"
