The randomness change of the facial design, eyes, and colors created varied mask NFTs.\n\nThe masks instantly conveyed the emotion of characters and different intended meanings. Even the same mask can have different feelings because of the viewer's different cultural background and life experience. Each COMP NFT is a unique artwork and has a specific collection value."
