  "description": "Salty Pirate Cabins is the third generation of the Salty Pirate Crew collection:\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/saltypiratecrew\nPower cabins will provide different scales of boosts to gameplay. If you own more than 1 power cabin you will be able to switch between them in your dashboard, but only 1 can be activated at a time. Each cabin will have a unique power play and switching between them will be an added level of strategy to the game. Owning only 1 will allow you to activate or deactivate it in your dashboard."
