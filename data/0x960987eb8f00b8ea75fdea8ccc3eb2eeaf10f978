  "description": "Galaxy Modificator is a collection of Rare and Legendary upgrade cards used for upgrading NFT Heroes to a higher rarity and status within SIDUS social society.\n\nNFT Heroes is a collection of unique characters. Only the Original 4,000 Heroes were available for purchase. The rest - 1,000 Rare and 500 Legendary NFT Heroes - are created using upgrade cards. To upgrade to the Rare status, a user needs to buy 1 Rare upgrade card and have an Original NFT Hero. To become part of the Legendary squad, the user needs to collect 3 Legendary upgrade cards and have an Original NFT Hero. Each upgrade card can be used only once. After the modification process, the user ends up with 2 NFTs - their Original NFT Hero and the upgraded, higher status one. \n\nRare and Legendary NFT Heroes entitle their holders to more benefits in the SIDUS community.\n"
