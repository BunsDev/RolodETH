  "description": "This is the OLD MagicFolk contract. \n\nThe NFTs can be burned in exchange for two new NFTs at https://magicfolk.io/mint\n\nNew collection: https://opensea.io/collection/magicfolk-genesis\n\nBurning one of these old NFTs will make you eligible to receive exclusive founder's items at a later date. The items depend on the token ID burned. \n\n**IDs _less_ than 398**: Founder's Weapon + Founder's Pet\n\n**All other IDs**: Founder's Weapon\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: Holder count is not accurate due to majority of NFTs being staked in the contract. Item count is also not accurate as NFTs burned in the [migration contract](https://opensea.io/0x2CAd060B169a4780746090Cf9a98d052cf75F92f) are still counted by OpenSea"
