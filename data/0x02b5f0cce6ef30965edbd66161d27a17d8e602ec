  "description": "STEALTH DROP\n\nUtility can be replicated. Visual art can be replicated. JPEGs and PFPs evidently can be replicated.\n\nThe Catch-22 contract fundamentally cannot.\n\nPROOF\n\nPremises\n\n(1) Created on the eminently unique, indisputably significant, since fully symmetric date:\n\n22-2-22\n\nA “Twosday” at that. Only once in four centuries. The very apex of rare.\n\n(2) Self-reference and purity: The contract solely references its own date of creation.\n\nWhich is unrivaled rare and relevant pursuant to premise 1.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe contract thus is itself unmatched rare, while conceptually unique. Hence cannot be replicated, imitated or cloned, for centuries.\n\nOnly 222 items total supply.\n\nFirst fundamentally novel, purely contract-level-rarity concept art NFT in the history of mankind. Stressing contract significance, images are mere placeholders, minimalist proxies of purport. Creation date, metadata and visuals eternalized and stored 100% on-chain.\n\nImmutable. Forever.\n\nFree Mint.\n\nProbably nothing."
