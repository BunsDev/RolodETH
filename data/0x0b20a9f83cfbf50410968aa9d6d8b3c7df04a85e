  "description": "Playboy and Sevens Foundation are proud to announce a first-of-its-kind partnership that brings a new four-part NFT grant-exhibition series focusing on Playboyâ€™s core editorial themes of Gender and Sexuality, Speech, Equality, and Pleasure to life. The collaboration provides underrepresented digital artists with the opportunity to mint and sell their work in the metaverse. Playboy and Sevens recognize how the fight for equality and representation that continues to define the art world at large is particularly urgent in the fast-moving world of NFTs. As such, the first installment of the series, *The Art of Gender and Sexuality,* invited applicants to celebrate the power of diverse identities and perspectives. The exhibit was curated by artists ix shells, Anne Spalter & Shantell Martin, and Playboy head of art & editorial Liz Suman & creative director Erica Loewy.
