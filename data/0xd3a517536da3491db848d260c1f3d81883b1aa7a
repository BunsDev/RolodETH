  "description": "6000 Critters are having a terrible day in the metaverse. These Critters have had the worst day and are about to completely flip out.\n\nWe’re building a board game that will be shipped for free to holders after a snapshot.\nAdditionally for us the board game isn’t the finish line. It’s just the start, as we aim to build the Cranky Critters brand for years to come."
