  "description": "Revest Finance Financial Non-Fungible Tokens represent the next step in the development of decentralized finance. Most positions in finance are non-fungible; until now, most protocols have squeezed these positions into fungible tokens, taking choice away from the end-user. By offering the ability to tokenize any non-fungible financial position into a series of ERC-1155 NFTs, Revest Finance is changing that."
