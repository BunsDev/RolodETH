  "description": "50 Rare 1/1 Blue Chip Derivative characters come with keys to the Myth Division's first metacity, Orangurock. These 50 Residents are the supporting cast of the [BASYC](https://opensea.io/collection/bored-ape-seeks-yacht-club-issue-0/) American Ape [Stories](https://opensea.io/assets/0x25ad43defbd8ae997f011556823b415f08936ce5/0).  \n\nAs a Resident, you have early access to our Sandbox Build, just two parcels south of the official Bored Ape Yacht Club. The Pawtown docks lead to Orangurock, a gamified retail and social hub experience with concerts, shows, panels, and insider access to some of Myth Division's work in Film and Television. \n\nEach resident is designed to be featured in the comic books and animations that Myth Division is already producing for global distribution. You can earn licensing fees by staking your character and you can sell your NFTs on the real estate you hold with your Orangurock Key."
