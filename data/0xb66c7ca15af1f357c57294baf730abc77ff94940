  "description": "The Gems of Awareness collection of unique NFT Animations, are crystallizations of our psychedelic visionary experiences. They portray the elevation of consciousness and identity with a higher power, languages of the Spirit and spectral geometries of the Soul. We are both painters, so each animation was based on a specific work and expanded by animation to new dimensions. Gems of Awareness, the first NFTs by artists Alex Grey & Allyson Grey, in collaboration with Trippy are offered to raise funds to complete Entheon, Sanctuary of Visionary Art at CoSM, an art church in the Hudson Valley of New York. This three story, 12,000 square foot art temple, scheduled to open in mid 2022, will exhibit works of the International Visionary Art movement portraying glimpses of transcendental realms. "
