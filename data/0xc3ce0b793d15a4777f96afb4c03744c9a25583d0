  "description": "In the new project, qubibi experiments and explores the idea of inverting a previous series entitled ‘MIMIZU’ - which led him to ‘wiwizn’. While ‘MIMIZU’ started out as an animation, the artist decided to create still NFTs to capture specific moments of the shapes and lines intertwining and emerging into each other. Their compositions are organic, abstracted and imbue a spiritual presence. They are colorful creations that range from chaotic and improvisational to careful and considered, seeking to show the deeper reality beyond the physical world. "
