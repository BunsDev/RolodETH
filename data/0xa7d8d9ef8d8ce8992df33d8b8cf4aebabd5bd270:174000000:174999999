  "description": "Letters to My Future Self is a series looking at communication through time. There is so much I want to tell my future self that words can't express: from the fear and anger I've felt in lockdown isolation to the joy in finding new friends and community. Each piece in this series becomes a small part of a much bigger story -- letters sent into the future expressing our collective hopes, fears, sadness, and love. A moment in time captured in perpetuity on the blockchain for future generations to find and reflect on. 25% of proceeds will support future artists through art education grants via Donors Choose."
