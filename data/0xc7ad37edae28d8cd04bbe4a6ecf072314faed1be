  "description": "[axons.art](https://axons.art)\n\nAxons is an infinite collection of generative pixel art, looking into the mind of a neural network (thus, no distinct traits can be distilled).\n\nA new Axon is chosen and auctioned on-chain daily based on decentralized community voting.\n\nArt is mirrored permanently on-chain. Auctions are conducted using a free, untradeable token obtained by participating in the voting process."
