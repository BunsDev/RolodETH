  "description": "REVEAL TODAY\n\n\nJoin our experiment while having fun!\n\nThe first time in the NFT space, you mint from **one contract** but get items from **two different collections.**\n\nWe love waiting for reveals, right? Why don't we experience the same excitement while minting? That's why we have developed Survived Ones' contract. It allows you to mint from the genesis collection if you are lucky enough or end up minting from the gen2 collection.\n\nOnce we decided to develop a contract like that, we tried to find the best idea that would make it easy to understand for everyone. And \"sperms\" are the best and most fun idea for that. \n\n**HOW DOES IT WORK?**\n\nWhen you mint a sperm, it has around an 8% chance to survive. \n\nIf it survives, you mint an item from the [\"Survived Ones\" collection.](https://opensea.io/collection/survived-ones-official) (GENESIS)\n\nIf it doesn't, you mint an item from the [\"Dead Ones\" collection.](https://opensea.io/collection/dead-ones-official) (GEN2)"
