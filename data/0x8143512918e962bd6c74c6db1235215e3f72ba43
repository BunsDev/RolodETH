  "description": "Flume: Flume, born Harley Streten, is an Australian songwriter and producer living in Los Angeles. He has released two albums—2012’s genre defining, self-titled debut and 2016’s massively acclaimed Skin—plus a rapturously received 2019 mixtape, Hi This Is Flume, and a handful of collaborative EPs.\r\n\r\nJonathan Zawada: Known for his multi-faceted approach to the field of art and design which weave both the analogue and digital, artist Jonathan Zawada often seeks to create tangible artefacts of transient, ephemeral virtual experiences in his work. Blending around the intersection and blend between the artificial and the natural, Zawada’s world is hyperreal—delicate, intricately detailed, bold and dynamic."
