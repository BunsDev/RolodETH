  "description": "Crypto Hobos Main Collection: https://opensea.io/collection/crypto-hobos\n\nCrypto Hobos Pet Partners is a special collection in the Crypto Hobo Universe.\nDespite the typical companion collection, Pets are made with the same high-end craftsmanship as the main one. \nEach trait for Pets was drawn by our Artist Valiahmed on paper with pencils, oil, and watercolors and then scanned before being destroyed, just as it was with Hobos."
