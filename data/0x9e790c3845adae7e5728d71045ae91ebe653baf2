  "description": "NODΞS is a mirrored on-chain, interactive, generative art experience. Each NODΞ is infinitely animated (no loops), and all begin from a \"blank canvas\".\n\nAside from the art itself, users will be able to use a unique breeding mechanic, called \"fusing,\" that involves a \"trait token\" system. Your piece will generate a set amount of non-tradable trait tokens that can be spent to influence the outcome of a secondary piece or \"fused piece\". This essentially allows you to customize (with limitations) your art in your own way to achieve an outcome that either you desire, is deemed rare or unique, or to just have fun with seeing what you can come up with. \n\nEach NODE features 'graph mode' which you can see by pressing the \"left arrow\" on your keyboard. You can interact with your piece in additional ways on our website: nodesnft.com"
