  "description": "**There is imminent restructuring coming for IT. It is advised at this time that you wait to trade or buy IT tokens until it is completed.** \n\n*What is information worth to you?*\n\nInformation Token was constructed to provide experienced and chain-agnostic insights to holistically improve our space. In an ecosystem surrounded by bad-faith actors, Information Token aims to stand apart by valuing transparency, merit, fairness, and growth.\n\nWe continue to attract crypto-native researchers with proven track records of on- and off-chain research to protect the key ethos of decentralization.\n\nInvestments, guidance, and results are things others promise. These are things we deliver.\n\nSo, what is information worth to you?\n\n[Purchase of the token does not guarantee full access to the Information Token (IT) discord, terms and conditions apply.](https://informationtoken.io/)"
