  "description": "[MINT IS LIVE](https://firezuki.art/) : firezuki.art\n\nI am Kuro. Creator and artist of FIREZUKI. I was born to a family that engages in the art world, which teaches me that a sentimental declaration decorates every art stroke. AZUKI pulled me from the void to aspire to my inner calling, honest in my artistic expression. “The bamboo that bends is stronger than the oak that resists.” Life is to bend down to the reason for your passion.\n\nHence, this fired version of Azuki pays homage to the pioneer in the space. From the underworld, FIREZUKI aspires to bring the best Azuki derivative with a strong focus on art quality and culture. Created for the people by the people. I hope that something I start will be everything, and everything that I start will be something."
