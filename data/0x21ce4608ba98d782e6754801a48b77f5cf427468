  "description": "MetaBunny consists of 10,000 Bunnies completely generated via computer algorithm. Their existence is to scare people but unfortunately not all of them looks scary. Sadly some are even cute! Every Bunny has a scary meter which represents how scary are they. This will be based on their accessory, appearance and the location they choose to scare people."
