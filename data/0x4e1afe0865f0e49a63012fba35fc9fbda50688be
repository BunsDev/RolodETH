  "description": "I am a visual abstract art and this is my first collection deployed on my own smart contract. A serie of my best 1/1 digital \"oil\" paintings with the same abstract expressionist touch from my traditional ones. Created on ArtSet and Procreate.\nThe pieces are \"Untitled\" as a decision to not influence the viewers perspective of the painting with a description.\nThe serie doesn't have a fixed amount of pieces set yet but will only be created and minted in 2022, marking the start of my digital journey in this direction."
