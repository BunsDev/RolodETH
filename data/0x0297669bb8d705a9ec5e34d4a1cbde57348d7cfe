Each of the Fishbowl Heads NFTs is programmatically generated and made up of a unique combination of Clothes, Bowls, Environments and Fishes, across 192 traits randomised for varying rarities, minted as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, with the media and metadata hosted on IPFS. The artwork is clean, cute, family friendly and appeals to a wide audience ranging from kids, newborns, adults to even elders. And needless to say, they make for an adorable profile picture."
