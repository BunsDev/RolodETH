  "description": "DUGHEIM is the first collection created by Marie Ra as her own manifesto in the web3 space.\n\nThe Web3 gives all of us the opportunity to show our own talents, the inner self, and simply allows us to be free, which means that everyone should try to enter this world, into which there is supposedly no entrance.\n\nDUGHEIM depicts the subtle interplay between different elements. \"This is the search for «limits of freedom» in my understanding.\"\n\nWatercolor clouds inspired the creation of this artwork. Just look at the circular patterns in the rainbow puddle, use abstract shapes, and create intricate compositions."
