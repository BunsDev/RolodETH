  "description": "Disclaimer: These are Dynamic NFTs. Token Art and Properties subject to change according to @JeffJag\n\n666 AI generated character artworks created using the same text prompt: \"Money has a body with many heads\" guided through selective evolutionary variation by JeffJag. Each NFT was also individually digitally embellished in Procreate.\n\nGrotesque NFTs. Satire NFTs. Political NFTs. These are not cute, they are horrific and disturbing and terrible. They bother me. That's why I like them. They're unexpected in a creepy way. These Hedz are corrupted by currency so deeply they take it all the way to their graves.\n\nThere is no discord, no utility, just art.\n\nGrotesque Money (gm) has corrupted their minds to the point where money became more important than anything. So cynical. FiatHedz are inspired by the antithesis: Art above money.\n\nI have listed a 15% commission on secondary sales on contract, but max 10% on OpenSea"
