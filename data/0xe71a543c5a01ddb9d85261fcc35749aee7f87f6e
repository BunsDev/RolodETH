  "description": "Artist FUTURA2000—most commonly known as a pioneer in New York’s “Subway School” of Graffiti, and as a forefather of global streetwear—has an almost three-decade career as an early mover in another genre of creativity: Digital Art. Inspired by seminal life events such as his seeing responsive HUD displays on fighter jets while serving in the US Navy, to ingesting the dense compositional architecture and technological overlays of Stanley Kubrick’s \"2OO1: A Space Odyssey” in 1968, Futura’s mind has always had a driving undercurrent from “The Grid.” Now, in 2021, the creation, distribution, and transaction of art on a digital platform is simultaneously welcomed—as it is perhaps overdue, unique to him."
