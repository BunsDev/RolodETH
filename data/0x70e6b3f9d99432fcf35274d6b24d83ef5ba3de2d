  "description": "[Crayon Codes](https://openprocessing.org/crayon) are customized generative artworks that converge the authenticity of NFTs and collective consciousness of the open source. Artists are selected and curated by [OpenProcessing](https://openprocessing.org), and primary sales are sold in batches on Crayon Codes.\n\nTo ensure authenticity, NFTs are first minted for the artist and then transferred to collectors. \n\nThe royalties from each sale are 5% original artist, 1.5% OpenProcessing, 1% Bitmark. \n\nView all projects at [Crayon Codes](https://openprocessing.org/crayon).
