These ectoplasmic demigods have turned our reality inside out, but fear not! The Chimerapillars have been summoned to save humanity from the Toddlerpillar apocalypse!\n\nToddlerpillar & Chimerapillar holders join an inter-dimensional art collective with access to 100s of exclusive airdrops from the Toddlerpillar Apocalypse graphic novel with hi-res files & commercial rights, Toddlerpillar vinyl toys, custom toy art shows, metaverse exhibitions & much more!\n\nThis project continues the twenty-year history of artist and gallerist Jon Beinart's renowned doll sculptures, imbuing them with fresh psychedelic energy from award-winning artist and madman, Tim Molloy."
