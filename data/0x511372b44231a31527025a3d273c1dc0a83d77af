  "description": "These Maps are the restored versions (fixed metadata) of the original [Maps Project](https://opensea.io/collection/torn-maps). They have exactly the same locations and map journey as the originals.\r\n\r\nMaps are (pseudo) randomly generated place names of waypoints along a adventurers journey, complete with a map. All data is stored on chain. Use Maps however you want and pair with your favourite adventure Loot. Part of the larger Loot Project metaverse."
