  "description": "Coldie's second collection on Nifty Gateway features 4 NFTs - 2 auctions and 2 editions. Each is a 3D rendering of Warren Buffet. A main theme in the works is Buffet's investments in gold, but failure to recognize Bitcoin as holding value through its properties of 'digital gold'.\n\nColdie is an award-winning mixed media artist whose stereoscopic 3D art has been featured in national juried art exhibitions, cryptocurrency conferences, and live auctions. His blockchain themed artwork gives a personalized visual representation of the disruptive industry. Coldie is the first artist to tokenize stereoscopic 3D art and photography on the blockchain. "
