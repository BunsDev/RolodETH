  "description": "CryptoZoo is an autonomous ecosystem where users can buy, sell, and trade exotic animal hybrid NFTs. Hybrids are categorized by rarity; the rarer your animal, the more they yield! Our goal is to mitigate the barrier to entry into NFTs with a viral, fun, and addicting game that provides real life value. Let the breeding begin at CryptoZoo.Co :)"
