  "description": "Adventure Cards is the first collectable card game stored entirely on chain. Each NFT includes 45 procedurally generated cards, enough to play a full game.\n\nInspired by LOOT and MtG, Adventure cards are crypto primatives. You can do anything you want with them. They are free to mint (except... you know... gas)\n\nThere are four types of cards: creatures, artifact, enchantments, and spells. You should notice some familiar things in there.\n\n8000 total (4888 minted, the rest are being auctioned or given to contributors.)\n\nhttps://0xAdventures.com/"
