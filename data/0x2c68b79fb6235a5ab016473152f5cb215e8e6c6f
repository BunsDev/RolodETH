  "description": "Confecta is a subtle visual game, played on a 4 x 4 grid of dots, that celebrates the pleasure of color.\n\nIt explores variations of simple forms and unique color combinations within the tight formal constraints of Contecta's system.\n\nThe series was created in 2022 using a hybrid of generative and procedural processes by Nick Kuder, an Associate Professor of art, graphic designer, and visual artist.\n\nThe collection consists of 100 unique works. Each piece is named in honor of an artist, designer, or scientist who contributed to the study of color through their work â€” including some who were directly significant in helping shape Kuder's own development as an artist and designer."
