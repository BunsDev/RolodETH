  "description": "A P1×3L is the atomic unit of digital and generative art. It can’t be quantified. A P1×3L is vibrant and alive. Artists choreograph P1×3Ls and P1×3Ls possess artists. P1×3Ls are ideas about image-making that transcend the technology they flow through. \r\n\r\nEach of the artists in the P1×3L exhibition has pushed the boundaries of digital and generative art in their own ways. As a counterpoint to the stream of technology being developed to make itself invisible, these artists foreground the materiality of their medium. And at a time when online spaces for digital and generative art are at the highest energy in over 20 years, this group of artists, who committed themselves to these fields a decade ago, remain vibrant creators. Their past work has stood the tests of time and their current work pushes forward. —Casey Reas"
