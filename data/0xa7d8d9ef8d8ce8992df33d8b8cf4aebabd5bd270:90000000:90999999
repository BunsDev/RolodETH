  "description": "Hashtractors are a collection of generative renderings of various parametric equations commonly know as \"strange attractors\". These equations are at the heart of chaos theory; a branch of mathematics focused on the study of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. A selection of 29 different equations has been made for this collection. Hash data is used as their parameters."
