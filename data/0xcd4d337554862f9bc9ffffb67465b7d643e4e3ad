  "description": "Inspired by Loot, we believe that the NFT space should also form multiple building blocks like DeFi. In the DeFi space, multiple basic financial protocols can be combined into a complex decentralized financial ecosystem. The subsequent development of the NFT space will also be the same, Role and Loot both will become important \"building blocks\" to form the future Metaverse.\r\n\r\n## Role is a seed, a seed account for Metaverse Game.\r\n\r\n**What is the difference between [Role] and [Loot]?**\r\n\r\n1. Role is the account character, and Loot is the equipment worn by the character.\r\n2. Role is created by users, while Loot is officially generated. \r\n   With Role, players can choose their own gender, basic attributes (strength/dexterity, etc.), race, and alignment. Occupations (Warrior/Mage/Dragon Knight, etc.) and traits are randomly generated by the contract. Players can create their own stories, interpret the characters according to their traits and occupations."
