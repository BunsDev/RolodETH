  "description": "This page is for edition pieces minted on Talbot's custom Manifold contract.\r\n\r\n1/1 artworks available on Superrare: https://superrare.com/ryantalbot\r\n\r\nAbout the artist:\r\nRyan Talbot is a contemporary 3D artist raised in Southern California. He has worked with a variety of brands over the years including Nickelodeon, Nissan, New Balance, Lil Nas X, America's Got Talent, Western Digital, Star Trek & more.\r\n\r\nSince 2021, Ryan has shifted his focus from client work to selling his personal artwork as NFTs.\r\n\r\nThe process of creating his animations usually begins with a sketch. From there, he blocks out each scene in a program called Cinema4D where he also does character modeling, keyframe animation, texturing, lighting and rendering. He is drawn to the medium of Digital 3D because it allows him to create photorealistic scenes that stretch the imagination of what can actually be captured on camera.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ryantalbot.com/"
