  "description": "An asterism is a pattern created by a collection of stars and the lines that mentally connect between them. Unlike constellations, they are a more general concept that can refer to any identified pattern of stars. The viewer is the one who draws in the sky and gives meaning to his creation. Asterisms in an interactive generative project that invites you to draw, name and save forever your own asterism. Through a generative algorithm, the script gives you the sky as a canvas where you can unfold your imagination as many times as you want based on the Token ID hash from the minting process. To be a user is to be a creator.
