  "description": "Scab shop is a curated gallery celebrating the artists who have evolved tattoo art and culture into what it is today and are defining what it will be tomorrow. As our digital selves serve to represent a larger part of our identity, scab shop serves these artists by extending the reach of their artworks across the physical/digital membrane so that we as collectors can curate our identity in all contexts in a way that helps us feel more like ourselves both online and offline."
