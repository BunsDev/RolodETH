  "description": "On September 10, 2021, the Grey Disclosures 51 paper was released by the Pentagon. It confirmed the existence of aliens among us, camouflaged carefully into the civilian population. Their goal: A full-scale invasion and colonization of planet Earth (that’s our planet, for those of you who don’t have a PhD in astronomy). There are currently 10,000 Invaders among us. We are reaching out to you, the civilian population, for help. You must capture an alien and hold it in your wallet for further study. Our planet will not be safe until they’re all neutralized.\n\nThe future of life as we know it depends on you...\n\nInvader Spaceships can be found here! <link>: https://opensea.io/collection/invaders-spaceships"
