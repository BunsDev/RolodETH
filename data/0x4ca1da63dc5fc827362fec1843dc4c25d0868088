  "description": "iSea Monsters is a Health NFT Collection of 2,222 randomly generated monsters ready to play and train with humans. Their goal is to help the community to live a better and healthier life. Each iSea Monster NFT works as a playable character inside the game Better Quest. Better Quest is the first health game that bridges real world activities with the metaverse. As you train in the real world, your monster levels up in the metaverse and can use those skills to compete against other monsters. While your health data is used to boost your monster's health, you remain the 100% owner of it."
