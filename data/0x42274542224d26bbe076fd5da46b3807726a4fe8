  "description": "1 jpeg = 12 bags of coffee\n\n0xCoffee is an innovative NFT project, connect Web3 ownership w/ e-commerce. Each NFT contains 12 claims for ethically sourced, craft roasted coffee from an award winning roaster. After all claims are redeemed the token grants 20% off all coffee on the 0xCoffee website, for life. Check the remaining claims of any token at 0xCoffee.io\n\nA portion of mint fees and creator royalties fees go toward building blockchain backed, fully transparent supply chains for coffee farmers. "
