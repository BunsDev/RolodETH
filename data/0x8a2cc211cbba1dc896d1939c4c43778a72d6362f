  "description": "SOL is a collection of 365 generative paintings that captures a precise moment in time, when the sun is rising above the horizon. Each generative output is influenced by real world 2023 astronomical data. Every location, date, time and sunrise angle is unique. This information is recorded at the bottom of each piece and on the Blockchain. Just like IRL, no two SOLs are alike."
