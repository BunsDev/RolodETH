  "description": "NuBloom: Fractal is a collection of unique flower species generated using Lindenmayer systems, which rewrite strings iteratively creating fractal patterns.\r\n\r\nThis series will be automatically minted on OpenSea as it's purchased, and will be the first generation of NuBloom flowers. Each generation will have its own distinct aesthetic and utilities."
