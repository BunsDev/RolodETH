  "description": "Assembly presents *The Views* by Yael Malka, a collection of photographs marking the space between destruction and regeneration, neglect and luxury. Calling attention to the luxury developments consuming many neighborhoods in New York City, Malka’s images show that construction sites begin with a visual language of violence. The viewing panels that Malka documents were lawfully required at every New York City construction site since 2013, offering the public a vantage point on these sites. The geometric cut-outs, photographed at various stages of demolition and construction, transform into portals—voids that both erase and envelope the space. Through the abstract studies of the wooden obstructions, Malka explores the boundaries between public and private. Malka is a Brooklyn based artist whose work has been featured at numerous venues around the US. This work is from her debut photobook."
