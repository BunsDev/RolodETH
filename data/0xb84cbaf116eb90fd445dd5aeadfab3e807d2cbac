  "description": "The Bad Guys is a collection of 1,221 free-to-mint NFTs, but they are ALL SCAMMERS! After breaking free, they were let loose causing mischief across the blockchain and even infiltrated Rug Pull Finder!!!\n\nLuckily, the community captured these Bad Guys and will receive exclusive access to mint the RPF collection in Q4, plus beta access to RPF's new app (dropping soon) and WL opportunities from projects with at least 3.5-star ratings! One lucky holder who stops the heist will be rewarded handsomely"
