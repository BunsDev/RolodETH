  "description": "The year is 2777 and the Cybonix Cyborgs have been forced off their home planet Cygonia by the Eldor Mystics. With only 1500 of the most elite Cybonix surviving the initial attack they have retreated to their top secret space facility on the dark side of Wordon's moon. Here the Cyborgs are building and training back up to seek revenge on the mystical warlords who savagely pillaged their world.\n\nCybonix Drones: https://opensea.io/collection/cybonix-drones"
