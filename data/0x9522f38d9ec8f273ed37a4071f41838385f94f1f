  "description": "Milk Serums are used to mint Teen Rebel Ape Club (TRAC) NFTs. TRAC is a collection of 8,888 Teenage Apes, derived from babies after ingesting these radioactive serums. Teen Rebel Ape Club launches on 01/22/22, and while you may redeem a serum to receive a TRAC ape, milk serums do not expire and may be kept indefinitely.\n\nEach type of Milk Serum corresponds to a specific rarity category of TRAC. Categories are as follows, in order of rarity: \n\n• Mutant Milk = Unique 1/1 Mutant TRAC\n\n• Whole Milk = Top 10% Rarity TRAC\n\n• 2% Milk = 10%-20% Rarity TRAC\n\n• 1% Milk = 20%-50% Rarity TRAC\n\n• Skim Milk = 50%-100% Rarity TRAC\n\nAfter using a milk serum to mint a TRAC, the serum is then burned, providing you with a Teen Rebel Ape Club NFT in exchange.\n\nTRAC Apes Collection: https://opensea.io/collection/teenrebelapeclub"
