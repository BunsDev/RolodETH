  "description": "Your ideas canâ€™t be boxed.\n \nFor 8 years, it has been our passion to educate and inspire the next generation of creators and entrepreneurs. As a minority-founded company, Meta Moguls is a collection and brand developed to represent diverse creatives and equip them with resources to turn their ideas into a reality.\n \nThis community-driven collection of 1,111 moguls on the Ethereum blockchain is hand-drawn by our Lead Artist, Breyden Boyd. The retro, comic book style artwork brings a unique energy to these outside-the-box characters. Holding a mogul from this genesis collection provides owners with exclusive, early access to each new release from Meta Moguls, including our upcoming 3,333-piece collection, future IRL events, clothing, $MOGUL token, and much more.\n"
