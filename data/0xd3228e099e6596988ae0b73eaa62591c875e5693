  "description": "# MUSEUM OF WAR\nA chronology of events of the Ukrainian history of modern times, set in stone. The NFTs are facts accompanied by personal reflections. The formula of each NFT is clear and simple: each token is a real news piece from an official source and an illustration from artists, both Ukrainian and international.\n\n# MISSION\nTo preserve the memory of the real events of that time, to spread truthful information among the digital community in the world and to collect donations for the support of Ukraine.\n\n# THE NFT'S\nwill be created in chronological order, according to the events so the true history will be saved and cherished. And artists will depict how the war is perceived by the peaceful population of sovereign Ukraine â€” from its full outbreak to the moment of Ukrainian victory celebration.\n\nThis is the official collection of the Ukrainian government and 100% of funds from the minting go directly to the official crypto accounts of the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine"
