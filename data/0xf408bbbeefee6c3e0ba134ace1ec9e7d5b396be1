  "description": "This project is about the living souls from Kerala. I was born and brought up in Kerala, a state in southern India.\nKerala is a multicultural state where people from all ethnicities and religions live together in peace and harmony. I have come across several people from these cultures throughout my childhood. My project aims to illustrate these characters and bring their story to life. I have tried using a different colour palette and subtle variations in style for each piece."
