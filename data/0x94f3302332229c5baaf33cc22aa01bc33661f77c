  "description": "Yunks are a synthesis of the color palette of artist Grant Riven Yun and the unmistakeable 10,000 CryptoPunks.\n\nYun’s work encapsulates an incredibly nostalgic feeling, due in large part to his limited, warm, and washed out color palette. Yunks mix this extremely online, technologically advanced symbol of the CryptoPunks, with the very nostalgic and naturalistic symbolism of Yun's palette. This results in both a blend and battle between online and the “real world”, between the past and the future.  \n\nThis work is not affiliated with CryptoPunks or Grant Riven Yun."
