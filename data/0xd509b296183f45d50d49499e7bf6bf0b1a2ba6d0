  "description": "[ETHMap](https://ethmap.app/) is a project created in February 2018 by the developer of [WeiCards](https://willdn.github.io/weicards/#/). It was discovered in August 2021 by a small group of crypto sleuths, and has since attracted a significant number of collectors.\n\nETHMap has 178 \"zones\" - countries that can be owned and traded by players. ETHMap Zones is a wrapper around the ETHMap contract that allows the zones to be used by other dapps such as OpenSea."
