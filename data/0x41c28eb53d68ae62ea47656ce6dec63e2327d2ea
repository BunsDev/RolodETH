  "description": "**The On-Chain Art Revolution Is Here!**\n\nMeet Avatizer, the innovative generative art project that leverages on-chain technology to generate beautiful faces totally independently from external servers or outside scripts. Each NFT, except for the initial draft (the legendary one), is dynamic and fully unpredictable, it changes automatically each day. It's close to impossible for two NFTs to be the same. Generation can be paused to preserve a specific image, or restarted, at any time.\n\nAvatizer was co-created by Andreas Preis - a skilled artist who worked with Google, Coca-Cola, Microsoft in the past - and Roman Kropachek, a marketer with 20+ years of experience in the software industry.\n\nNOTE: OpenSea takes some time to cache the NFTs once the faces are reloaded. If your NFT takes too long to update, try clearing your browser cache and refreshing the listing."
