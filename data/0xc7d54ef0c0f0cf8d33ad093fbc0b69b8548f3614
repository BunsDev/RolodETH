  "description": "Demonica is a bold new soft rogue-like RPG P2E. In the game, you’ll explore an ocean of shattered realities in beautiful isometric 3D. Explore dungeon spaces as small as a haunted diner, or vast as an cyberpunk arcology. Plucked from myth, popular culture, and even Earth’s history - each world space will have its own rules. You’ll fight in turn-based combat against an array of creatures, level up and gain new skills and abilities. And yes, you’ll earn NFTs by playing.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DemonicaNFT\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/demonica\n\nWebsite: https://demonica.io/\n\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/DemonicaNFT"
