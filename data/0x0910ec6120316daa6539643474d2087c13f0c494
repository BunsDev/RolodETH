  "description": "**One of the earliest NFT games.**\n\nPanda Earth NFTs are beautiful artifacts of blockchain gaming history.\n\nIn early 2018, Panda Earth was a first of its kind virtual breeding game designed to promote real-world Panda conservation. By late 2018, it was abandoned. The Chinese developers left suddenly, crippling the project. 15% of the Panda NFTs became “‘extinct” as the metadata was stored on now dead servers. \n\nFast forward to 2022, and the Panda NFTs are back. A global community rescued the project by innovatively wrapping the Panda NFTs with intact 2018 metadata. We’re now helping save real wildlife through our community-run PanDAO. \n\nSo buy a Panda, own a piece of blockchain history, and join our fight to support wildlife\n\n**Panda Earth. We’re back from extinction.**\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/PandaEarthNFT\n\n[Unwrapped Collection Page](https://opensea.io/collection/pandaearth)\nPlease do not purchase the \"Content Not Available Yet\" NFTs - No Images were made and cannot be wrapped."
