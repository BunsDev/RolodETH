  "description": "Talitaâ€™s Genesis presents her main influences during her path as an artist. Her works illustrate urban, pop, cyberpunk, otaku, and crypto culture and are inspired by multiple mediums: games, books, movies, and music.\n\nThe artist explores how her sensitivity and creativity result from a trajectory surrounded by women who inspire her strength and courage to be what she is every day.\n\nIn addition to the art, the tokens bring the holder a series of benefits within the project, exclusive airdrops and early access to the community's private discord.\n\nHer Genesis is an introduction to unBlock Heads, a collection of NFTs that includes 10 Genesis Illustrations split into two drops, 100 1/1 Heads, and a 10k ERC-721 contract.\n"
