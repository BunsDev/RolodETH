  "description": "Japanese artist Hajime Sorayama is one of the most prolific artists and illustrators of this century. He is renowned for his “superrealism” style and his detailed, provocative, and often erotic portrayals of robots. Sorayama’s work for Sony’s robotic dog AIBO has landed him in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) and the Smithsonian Institution. Sorayama has also worked with iconic fashion brands such as Marc Ecko and Dior. Collaborations include George Lucas, Aerosmith, and Marvel’s Iron Man."
