  "description": "One night I had a dream. This dream was about capturing Teddycows on cold mesmerizing frosty mornings with a layer of fog near my hometown. And guess what, that dream came out! This collection takes you on a journey with Teddycows in the most dreamiest winter wonderland, it showcases a variety of special intimate moments with not only the brown-reddish Teddycows but also black and white ones. All the photos are taken within 15 minutes from where I live, I’m privileged with opportunities like this. \n\nThe total size of this collection is open, so this gives me the opportunity to add some more photos to the collection when I’m lucky to have some more magical mornings like this.
