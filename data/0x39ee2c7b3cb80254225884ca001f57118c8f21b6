  "description": "The Potatoz is a collection of 9,999 utility-enabled PFPs. Each Potatoz is your entry ticket into the great [Memeland](https://www.memeland.com/) ecosystem. They make for a great side dish, but some may feel a calling to become the main course. Rumour has it they are secretly related to the Memelist, $MEME, [MVP](https://opensea.io/collection/youtherealmvp), and more!"
