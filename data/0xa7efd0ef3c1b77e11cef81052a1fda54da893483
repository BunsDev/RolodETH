  "description": "Samuro’s Judgement is a limited collection of 50 unique variations based on Nyoman Masriadi’s Old Master Samuro character. Each variation of Samuro in crouching pose presents an animated scenario that allows co-creation and customisation with digital assets airdropped to the collector. Once the co-creation process is completed, the collector may additionally opt to purchase the Print Token for a monoprint hand-signed by the artist."
