  "description": "Ted Chin is a digital artist and photographer from Taiwan now based in San Francisco, USA. He is most well known for his Photoshop composite art. Ted's work can be described as a fantasy world with a touch of surrealism, sometimes with spirits of nature. Ted has been working within digital production for the last 6 years, producing work for countless clients across the globe. His most recent accomplishment is the Adobe Photoshop 2021 splash screen cover artist. There are things in the world that inspire childlike wonder and awe, and it is Ted's passion to recreate and share them with the world."
