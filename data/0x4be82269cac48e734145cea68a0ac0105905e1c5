  "description": "Cryptogam is a collection of unique AI generated 1/1 artworks by Phil Bosua.\n\nA cryptogam is a real thing. In the physical world cryptogams are ferns, moss, algae, or fungi. Each spherical spore is abstract, individual and indivisible from the group. Replicating without restriction to protect themselves. Their energy forms DNA infrastructure. They are forever decentralized.\n\nIn the digital world they are a trusted store of information. Each spherical node is abstract, individual and indivisible from the group. Replicating without restriction to protect themselves. Their energy forms source code infrastructure. They are forever decentralized.\n\n“Replication is a cyclic process leading gradually to wisdom. Replication is what the blockchain is. Listening to each other and teaching each other through love and art. We are collectively ever voyaging towards our purest happiness until the end of time.” – AI\n\n-- Phil Bosua is a part of the AIM collective. --\n\nhttp://aimc.ai/"
