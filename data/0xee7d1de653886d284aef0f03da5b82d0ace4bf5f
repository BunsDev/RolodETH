  "description": "MetaVolution is a utility-driven P2E NFT Game that unlocks a world of possibilities on Day 1. \n\nLands are a central part of the MetaVolution P2E ecosystem. They yield $TROPY (when at least 1 Immortal is staked) based on their tier and bring more utility to the game. https://opensea.io/collection/metavolution-immortals\n\nYou can either secure a land here or by burning 4 different Obelisks together. https://opensea.io/collection/metavolution-obelisks\n\nThe Lands help your Immortals progress through the game faster and increase your chances of ultimately defeating the final boss Luciverse. Lands will also have a significantly more important role when Season 2 is released at the end of 2022.\n\nVisit https://www.metavolution.io/ for more details."
