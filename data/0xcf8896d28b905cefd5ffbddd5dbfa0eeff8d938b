  "description": "New beginning.\n\nHome of Apiens!\n\nPlease note that the number of Apiens holders shows a substantially lower number in Opensea due to the Apiens staking program. This is due to the staked Apien NFT’s being held in a contract instead of a wallet, thus the number of Apiens holders drops.\n\nWhat are the benefits of the Apiens staking program you ask?\nStaking rewards:\n\n•    Weekly raffles to win eth or an NFT\n•    Shared revenue on Gen 1 secondary market sales\n•    Shared revenue on Gen 2 mint sales\n•    Shared revenue on Gen 2 secondary market sales\n•    Shared revenue on our shoe collab mint sales\n•    More to come!\n\nApiens is a collection of meta inspired fashionable young 3D apes which started with a vision to make blockchain integrated clothes for NFT enthusiasts back in January 2022. Apiens’ characters are the combination of youthfulness, fashion, and dignity which are going to inspire the next generation of fashion. \n\nGenesis collection: https://opensea.io/collection/genesis-apiens"
