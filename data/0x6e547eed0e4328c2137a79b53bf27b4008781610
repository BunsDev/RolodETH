  "description": "Woody Gooch’s 7 Atmospheres transports viewers through a dreamscape of raging oceans, contemplative landscapes and cosmic theatre. Often featuring friends and locals engaged in a dance with Mother Earth, the collection of 100 works reads like a poetic journey across Morocco, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, Japan, Australia and the United States. Coming from a deeply personal reverence for the beauty and diversity of the natural world, 7 Atmospheres is equal parts travel journal, daydream and meditation. This is Woody’s genesis NFT collection, co-curated by Barry Sutton for 96 Studio."
