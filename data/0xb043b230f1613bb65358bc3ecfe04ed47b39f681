  "description": "Zales Chapter I is 9,999 art pieces of 10 different kinds of fish in total.\r\n\r\nIt will be minted as different patches, which we will call “waves”. Each wave will open a different number of Zales NFTs, which have the potential to be minted, and have a different mint price.\r\n\r\nEach wave has a different fish kind and only reveals at the mint. Collecting different fish kinds to make it combo will give you ETH reward. Each combo's reward is more than mint prices."
