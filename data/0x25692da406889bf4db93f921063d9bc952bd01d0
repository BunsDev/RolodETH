Itsuki team is doxed and has been in the NFT space for more than 1 and half years as artists. \r\nThey have been building Itsuki for more than 5 months and growing the community organically. \r\n\r\nOn every mint, Itsuki will be planting a real tree in a real-world and start a new era in the crypto world. Where the way trees maintain the life balance in the environment. In the same way it will play a major role in carbon neutrality and yet create a utility for the holder with the power of GameFi.
