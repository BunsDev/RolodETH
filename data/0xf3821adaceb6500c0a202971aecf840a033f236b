  "description": "MIGRATED TO: https://opensea.io/collection/distortion-genesis\n\nTHE CONTRACT IS EXPLOITABLE. PLEASE STOP BUYING FROM THIS COLLECTION.\n\nDistortion is a fully hand-typed 100% on-chain art collection limited to 1,000 pieces. It is designed to be displayed with no external browser libraries (e.g. p5js).\n\nDistortion's skeleton is wrapped within a smart contract which will use the hash of the block of the 1000th and final mint as an input to make sure the collection has an immutable and verifiable provenance."
