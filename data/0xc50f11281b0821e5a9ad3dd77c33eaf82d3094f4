  "description": "To mint a **Dystolab Crate** you need to go to our [website](https://dystopunks.net/) holding a [DystoPunk](https://opensea.io/collection/dystopunks) in your wallet and burn **300 $CREDS**.\n\nDystolab Crates content can be used in Metaverse Avatars: [DystoPunks VX](https://opensea.io/collection/dystopunks-vx)\n\nSomething strange is happening in the **Dystoverse**, a hooded entity is packaging strange stuff into tech-locked crates. No one really knows what crates contain, rumors say that they contain high-tech implants and weapons but no one is able to open them. The crates are minted in a vending machine called **Dystolab Machine** and looks like crates are numbered up to 7777 only.\n\nThis hooded entity said that only in the **Dystolab** is there a tool to open the crates, so [DystoPunks](https://opensea.io/collection/dystopunks) will have to wait until the **Dystolab** is built to unlock its rewards."
