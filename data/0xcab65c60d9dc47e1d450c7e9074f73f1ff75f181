  "description": "**WARNING: BEFORE BUYING PLEASE CHECK [THE PROOF OF STEAK VALIDATOR](https://app.dogsunchainednft.com/validate) TO SEE IF THE STEAK HAS A BALANCE**\n\nA first-of-its-kind NFT reservation. A Proof of Steak can represent the ability to redeem a Dog from the Dogs Unchained collection at mint. It must have a balance to do so.\n\nProof of Steaks will remain in an owner's wallet even after being used to redeem a Dog. Being a Steakholder will provide extra community perks within Dogs Unchained.\n\nProof of Steaks are available to early Dogs Unchained community members to help reduce gas wars and ensure everyone was able to take part in the project."
