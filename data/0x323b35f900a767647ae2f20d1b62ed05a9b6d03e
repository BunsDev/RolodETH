  "description": "MAD Metacells are a dynamic NFT that represents a single cell organism that evolves for eternity (and earns you $BIOMETA in the process).\n\nAll MAD Metacells start from 'Evolution Stage 0', leaving it up to the owner to create its' rarity by experiment with it in The Lab, generating new evolutions, mutations and enhancements. \n\nIn The Lab  - a web3 gamified platform to experiment with Evolving NFTs - players will be able to start experimenting with their MAD Metacell NFTs, and generate crypto and NFT rewards. \n\nInside The Lab, players can experiment with different mechanics to evolve, mutate and enhance the MAD Metacells.\n\nVia the Host Protocol -  a feature within The Lab -  players can use their 3rd-party NFTs to mutate and evolve their MAD Metacells, generating new\nvisual and in-game traits. MAD Metacells can also split and generate MAD Nanocells.",
