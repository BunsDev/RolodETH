  "description": "[The GBs](https://twitter.com/gmgbae) are a collab between artist [Glitchybitches](https://twitter.com/glitchybitches) and Divergence (tech team of [Moonbirds](https://opensea.io/collection/proof-moonbirds), PROOF, [Brotchain](https://opensea.io/collection/brotchain) & Kiss Precise). Glitchybitches and/or GBae are artist alter-egos of designer Beth Altringer Eagle, who made the art, world, and story. The GB portraits, their magical world, and epic tale have already been created. They are designed to reveal in time over six acts. Each GB has six versions to reveal. \n\nBorn of multiple worlds, 10101 GBs explore and bridge new lands, fight dark forces, raise armies, avenge deeds, make magic, transcend time, and must create and defend a new world. Clues and symbols from all six acts, puzzles, and even a hidden language are hidden in GB portraits. Though set long ago, when you learn the beginning of their story, you’ll see it everywhere today. \n\n[Mint here](https://www.glitchybitches.com/)"
