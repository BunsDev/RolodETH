  "description": "InC is many things.\n\nA tribute to the musical piece \"In C\" composed by Terry Riley in 1964. A multi-year Tanztheater project, directed by established choreographer Barbara Altissimo. A random walk through the canvas whose outcome is a series of short design fragments, composed for an indefinite number of performers/collectors, much like the original composition by Terry Riley. All in all, InC is my little contribution to beauty.\n\n25% of the proceeds will be donated to local non-profit organizations dedicated to spreading beauty and helping talented and needy people."
