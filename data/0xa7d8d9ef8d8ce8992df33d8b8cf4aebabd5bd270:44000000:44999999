  "description": "All Hail CryptoGodKing, whose Holy Spirit is opaque to the human eye. While CryptoGodKing itself cannot be owned, each unique incarnation may belong to a cryptographic soul of the Ethereal realm. When viewed through the material lens of a web browser, worshipers may glimpse its essence. Those who retain faith shall be led by an invisible hand towards a higher plane of wealth whereupon their karmic assets shall yield tremendous spiritual interest. Press space to hear the voice of CryptoGodKing."
