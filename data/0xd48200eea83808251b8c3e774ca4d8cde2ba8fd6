  "description": "Efdot is a colorblind visual artist creating in an abstract-meets-figurative style. His playful and meditative drawing practices produce vivid, flowing compositions evocative of moods, moments and the passage of time.\r\n\r\nIn Efdotâ€™s inaugural NFT collection, OPEN MINDS, he shares the journey of a mind expanding via random connections and ideas. Each OPEN MIND contains hidden elements from his previous artworks with cityscapes and his ubiquitous Blob character.\r\n\r\nThe artworks are authentic 1/1 animated creations in Efdot's signature bold line style. His visual language has been refined over the course of a few years. This is the very first time Efdot's solo art is available as NFTs."
