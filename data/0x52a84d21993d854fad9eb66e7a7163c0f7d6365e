  "description": "http://discord.gg/XEbaVw7s7R\n\nAn anime styled PFP collection with a strong community-oriented roadmap that is driven by like-minded individuals who will vote on shared interests and prevent Asian hate crimes.\n\nWe are sharing our art/project with a free mint phase, where royalties will go to Anti-Asian hate donations, benefits to our OG holders, and launching an artist marketplace. 30 lucky holders will be able to customize their own NFT character, as our OG holders have been doing! \n"
