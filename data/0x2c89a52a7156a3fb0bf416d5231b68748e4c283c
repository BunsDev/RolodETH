  "description": "We believe music best comes alive when there's context people can connect to emotionally. We see ourselves as creators that help artists rewrite those stories using the power of NFTs. Web3 allows artists to create with more freedom and connect with fans on a much deeper level, our mission is to live at the intersection of that culture."
