  "description": "Accursed Share’s genesis piece, the 1/1 Curse NFT, is a 4K 3D-image of Krystall Schott produced by PROTAGON, the visual effects wizards for Marvel. It is the first NFT to integrate Chainlink’s revolutionary Keeper technology to create the first dynamic NFT to evolve in response to the changing price of Ethereum.\n\nCurse NFT will have five different presentations. When the price of ETH goes up for 1 and 2 days in a row, the NFT will display positive 3D renderings. When the price of ETH decreases for 1 and 2 days in a row, the displays will be negative. Finally, when the price of ETH hits 20K, Krystall’s face will be displayed in its full blessed form."
