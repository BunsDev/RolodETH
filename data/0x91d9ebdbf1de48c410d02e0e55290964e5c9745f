  "description": "Vapor95 is a Los Angeles based team of Vaporwave enthusiasts. Their common vision is to provide a platform and infrastructure to Vaporwave artists to express their creativity and monetize their work. Along with their clothing collection, they also branch out into posters, candles, music and blogging. You can check them out here: [http://www.vapor95.com](https://vapor95.com) \n\nThis collection is titled “Invitation To Ascension”. It represents the end of the “modern age” and our accelerating approach towards the Singularity, or the Neo Modern Age. The sunken CRT monitor is indicative of the post 9/11 internet society, and the fractal spiral orbs above and glowing doorway in the distance represents the approaching Epoch and our invitation to ascension. The whole scene being framed by the Roman pillars is symbolic of the enduring beauty of aesthetics through our transition technologically, societally and spiritually."
