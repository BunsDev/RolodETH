  "description": "Qubits are voxel characters living in the metaverse. Each Qubit is unique in it's own way with different traits for the body type, glasses, ears, caps, shoes and tattoos. They come in a super shiny box (the box also has traits and rarity). You as the owner can then decide whether or not to unbox your Qubit (using an awesome Dapp) or leave it in.\n\nMint your Qubits at - http://qubitsontheice.com/"
