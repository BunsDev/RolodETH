  "description": "From now onwards, buying the MirrorDAO pass from the secondary market, such as Opensea, will no longer give you OG role and will instead give you the @Mirror-Trial. This gives all NEW MirrorDAO Pass holders that buy starting from Now with free access to solely the Doodles mirror, without the need of any invites. We'd like to emphasise that this is simply a TRIAL to access the mirror, and we will keep you updated as we move forward."
