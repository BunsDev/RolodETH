  "description": "The \"Surreal Estate\" is a limited collection of completely generative architectural renditions. Each work is unique and generated from artificial intelligence using a deep learning tool called diffusion modeling.\n\nThe classical shapes, patterns, and colors of traditional architecture are captured from millions of images and then transformed into the synthetic buildings, shapes, and cityscapes seen in each composition."
