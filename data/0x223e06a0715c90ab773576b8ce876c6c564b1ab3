  "description": "What is PEEP?\nPEEP is a new paradigm of creator-centric, community-driven spontaneous innovation.\n\nPEEP Series #1: #Satoshi\nFor the PEEP Genesis Series, the first topic will be about #SATOSHI. Here is what you need to know:\n● Total number of NFTs = 2100 in the spirit of Satoshi’s 21M BTC max supply.\n● One wallet address can only claim one token/NFT.\n● First come, first serve. When the claim is over, there will be no more.\n● It is on the ETHER chain. CLAIM only requires GAS FEE.\n● There are serial numbers, from 0001-2100; the serial numbers are cast in the order of who claims.\n● Users can write text, like using TWITTER, and cannot exceed the 210-character limit.\n● The theme of the first issue is #SATOSHI."
