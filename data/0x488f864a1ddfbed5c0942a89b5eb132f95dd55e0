  "description": "Lipsies is a collection that was born shortly after the creation of Smoochies. Only 100 Lipsies will ever exist and it is up to the community to decide when each Lipsie will be brought to existence. Only 1/1 Smoochie holders from the Maetherial collection and holders of 2 or more Deadlips are elligible for a free airdrop. The rest will be auctioned both in an online and offline manner in notable venues.\n\nImages of Lipsies down below are only a portion of the 100 that will be available for both holders (airdrop) and the public through auctions (offline/online). This project is still a work in progress, so be up to date about the launch, snapshot and airdrops on this twitter link: https://twitter.com/ndreasivan"
