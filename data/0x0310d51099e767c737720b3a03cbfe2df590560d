  "description": "\"A collective project created and directed by Cedric Hervet, French visionary designer and former Daft Punk creative director.\n“I do not usually like to explain the meaning of a work, I think it’s up to the viewer to interpret. Each cube is a representation of a human being, hence the name, “Cubeing”\n\nCubeing collective project will create special artifacts exclusively available for Kooola City, stay tuned\""
