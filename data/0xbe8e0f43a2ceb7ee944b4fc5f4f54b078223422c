  "description": "The Cosmos collection is inspired by a room in my immersive exhibition, Cascade. For Cosmos, I selected unique elements from this room, and transformed them into a collection of intergalactic singular works. Each shape in this series emits a symphony of unique tones and is inspired by the flow of the universe ○ Artwork: Jen Stark ○ Animation and Sound: CutMod ○ 2021 ○ 1/1"
