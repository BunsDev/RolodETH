  "description": "DONT BUY THIS ACCESS KEY!!! **READ BELOW**\n\nRead: we wanted to appreciate our community with a much better art for the Nabu Pass rebranding, so we created ( [NABU PASS](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xac3dc4977d299e879de123e1cd997047fa936d73/0) ) and airdropped it to the previous holders, if you want to buy our access key make sure to buy the new one, there is no value in having this in your wallet, just hide it because itâ€™s **UGLY**."
