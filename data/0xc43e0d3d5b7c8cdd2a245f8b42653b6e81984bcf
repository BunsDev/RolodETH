  "description": "The genesis of my curler collection, started one day on the boulevard Magenta in Paris in the spring. I was walking with my son and I passed an \"old school\" hairdresser, and there I was captivated by the store window. It was full of heads with curlers. It was a flashback, my childhood with my mother using them. I had to make a series honoring this emotion.\n\nThe collection was made in 2 shoots, the spring and summer series.\n\nIt is a series of 11 photos that appeared from this feeling."
