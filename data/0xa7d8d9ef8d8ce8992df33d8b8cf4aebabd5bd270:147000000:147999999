  "description": "Trossets explores the emergence of diversity. Combining twelve construction blocks the system generates endless patterns with a unique result each iteration. Trossets /trus…õts/ means parts, blocks, pieces and it's my particular homage to a classical generative system, the multiscale Truchet tiles. The systems plays an interlocking blocks game creating unexpected drawings with colors borrowed from the Mediterranean. To keep this colors alive 10% of the profits will be donated to Marilles Foundation, an NGO for marine conservation (https://marilles.org/en). And 15% of the minting profits will go to OpenArms, an NGO that helps refugees that try to cross the Mediterranean (https://www.openarms.es/en)."
