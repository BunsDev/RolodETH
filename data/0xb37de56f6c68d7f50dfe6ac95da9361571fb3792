  "description": "Bitchcoin: Genesis are Sarah Meyohas's fine art documentation of the original Bitchcoin mine at Where, a gallery in Brooklyn, New York, in February of 2015. Meyohas wrapped the interior of the gallery, headquartered in a 40-foot shipping container, with a reflective mylar surrounding a single mining computer and monitor.\n \nThe artist launched the social token as an artist-made-Bitcoin fork which allowed collectors to invest in Meyohas directly, and could be exchanged in perpetuity for her artwork.\n\n\"Our operations test the assertion that art manifests the same patterns, behaviors, and properties present in all complex informational systems. Acknowledging the powers and perils of systems-based thinking, we suspect that the mechanisms identified as producing growth and complexity in large-scale systems may be directly applicable to the field of artistic production. We use the exhibition format as a site for researching these mechanisms.\" - Lucy Hunter and R. Lyon, Where"
