  "description": "HIGHSNOBIETY Not In Paris has democratized fashion week. Instead of invite-only shows behind closed doors, we bring the experience to where creativity really flourishes — the internet. Since HIGHSNOBIETY Not In Paris is so rooted in the digital, this year, we had to create our own series of NFTs to commemorate the project. \n\nHIGHSNOBIETY Not In Paris has always played with Parisian stereotypes, drawing equal inspiration from tourist aesthetics and the city’s surrealist past. For our series of NFTs, we played around with some of Paris’ most recognisable icons — a macaron, a wheel of brie, a spliff, the Eiffel Tower, and a Café de Flore coffee cup — and gave them the HIGHSNOBIETY treatment.
