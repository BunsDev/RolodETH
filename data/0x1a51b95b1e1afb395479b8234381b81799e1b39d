  "description": "Discovered in dusty crates deep below Wasder HQ, these mysterious devices looks as if they can be plugged into something. The WSDR LAB science team are working day and night to reveal their purpose, the only clues they have is that there are 5000 of these devices and they all read “Activation Drive” on the side. Could it be the key to a new breed of NFTs? Our scientists aim to crack the Activation Drive enigma in Q3 2022."
