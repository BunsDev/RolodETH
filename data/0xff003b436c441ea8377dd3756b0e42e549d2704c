  "description": "**MULTIVERS3 by W3 ART & JULI3N RISSO**\n\n The MULTIVERS3 is composed of many UNIVERS3s, in which, each NFT represents a planet.\n\nThis first series is called UNVERS3 I. It is composed of 2600 NFTs.\nEach NFT will be randomly generated from a\nmultitude of traits (Characters, Planets, Dunes, Stars, Rockets...) representing more than 50 Billion combinations, and each one has its own generated Planet Name.\n\nThe MULTIVERS3 NFTs will provide multiple utilities within the W3 ART ecosystem, which will be progressively announced in the coming weeks."
