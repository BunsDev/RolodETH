  "description": "Hilma af Klint (1862â€“1944) was born in Stockholm where she studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. She established herself as an artist, exhibiting figurative paintings. As a devout Christian she later became involved in spiritualism, and interested in the ideas of Rosicrucian theosophy and anthroposophy. In 2018 a large survey at the Guggenheim Museum in New York became the best-attended exhibition in the history of the institution. Of the 386 NFTs, an edition of 193 (or 50%) is held as a donation to the official foundation. The remaining 193 are available commercially.\n"
