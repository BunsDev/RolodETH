  "description": "Welcome to Inku a 1k NFT Genesis collection. Meet ghosts , fight demons , and battle the undead..\n\nInku’s live in a world currently in conflict. They want peace but are jeopardized by Demons and the Undead. Their allies, the Ghosts, offer protection and guidance for the Inku’s. The Demons possess Inku’s, making them The Undead. Inku’s must do what they can to take down the Demons and regain peace, hopefully finding a way to save those that have been affected by the Demons. If Inku’s are able to overcome the Demons, the Ghosts will finally be able to move onto the next realm in peace."
