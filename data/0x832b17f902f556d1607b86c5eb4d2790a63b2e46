  "description": "SLUM STARS is pixel art created freely by the children and young adults living in the slums of Agbogbloshie, Ghana. It’s an NFT project for social good, aiming to help support their daily lives and future dreams by giving back 50% of secondary royalty fees.\n\nIn Agbogbloshie, both children and adults live in undesirable conditions to survive. MAGO Mint’s mission is to provide an opportunity for the “STARS” to use their imagination and create a new path to their lives through art and technology. \n\nCulture, economy and environment all circulate in a well balanced matter, making “Sustainable Capitalism” possible with Web3. "
