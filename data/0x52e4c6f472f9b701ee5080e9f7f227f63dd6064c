  "description": "IMPORTANT: Expand for full details of the collection.\r\n\r\nThe Everyrealm x Atari Collective is a community dedicated to Atari and the origins of gaming. Key players include holders of Everyrealm x Atari’s 50th Anniversary Commemorative GFT Collection. Collective members are to gain exclusive benefits tied to Everyrealm’s Gaming and AtariX’s (Atari’s Blockchain Arm) initiatives. Benefits and utility of being a member can be found at https://atarigft.everyrealm.com/atari/#benefits\r\n\r\nNote: Once a GFT is redeemed for a pass it CANNOT be used again. To check, use the GFT Redemption Checker tool at https://atarigft.everyrealm.com/#check. Do NOT trust that the “Redeemed” Property on individual OpenSea GFT listings is accurate as the property may take a while to update on OpenSea after a GFT is redeemed. Use the Checker tool instead.\r\n\r\nLearn more about the collective at: https://atarigft.everyrealm.com/"
