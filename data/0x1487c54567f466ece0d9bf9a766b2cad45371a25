They were banned from their home world by the supreme court of Justice, branded \"Too dangerous to live amongst us\", so they were exiled.\nIn Louz city they are free to shape their lives and live dangerously. The city is made up of 5 territories, each ruled by 1 sovereign woman who keeps order amongst them. But order cannot last for long, as anarchy is in their nature and chaos lingers in the shadows.\nARE YOU READY TO MEET THE 7777 WOMEN OF LOUZ?"
