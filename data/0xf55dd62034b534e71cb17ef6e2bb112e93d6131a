  "description": "1024 algorithmically generated audiovisual NFTs. Created by 404.zero.\r\n\r\nNoise is another form of perception. It’s one of the most abstract of the visual and auditory forms. Both simple and complex generators were used to produce the Hidden in Noise collection: gradients, perlin and white noises, and a number of custom made generators.\r\n\r\nThe outputs of the generators combine in multiple ways in random orders with random math operations. That’s the order of Chaos."
