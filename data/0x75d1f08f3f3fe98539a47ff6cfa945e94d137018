  "description": "Before there was Man, there was Woman.\n\nWild Eve is the story of the sacred feminine, the original human who danced the Earth, in complete harmony with her nature. She crossed the mountains with her bare feet, she ate from the trees and drank from pristine rivers. Eve cared for the soil and blessed the animals. Her touch was that of nurture and compassion for the land.\n\nDear Eve, what have we done?\n\nWild Eve is a total collection of 50 1/1 images.\nNew works will be added periodically..."
