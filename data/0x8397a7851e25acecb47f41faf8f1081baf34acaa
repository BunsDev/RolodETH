  "description": "The first collection by XPHYEE. This collection has been re-minted onto its own contract, all previous mints on OS Storefront contract will be vaulted away with this being the main collection.\n\nA collection of 55 playing card designs created by XPHYEE, each numbered card has been made with a different approach in creating the base model, designed as a sort of organised sketchbook of experiments to help XPHYEE develop as an artist over the years of his career.
