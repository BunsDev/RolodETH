  "description": "I'm not sure. It's pretty subtle, but this appears to be an NFT. It was mysteriously dropped to Degenaissance holders. It claims to be a LIT Collaboration. But with who or what? I better hold and find out. I don't want to miss anything. \r\n\r\n\"I think now is a very good time to embrace the fear.\"\r\n\r\nhttps://discord.gg/neverfeartruth\r\n\r\nNote that by entering this Discord, you entering a space run by another team that is not affiliated with LIT. One we believe you’ll be very excited to meet. However, do all necessary due diligence. And know that you’re early.\r\n\r\n*Proceeds have been earmarked for two specific charities, which will be announced after the reveal.*"
