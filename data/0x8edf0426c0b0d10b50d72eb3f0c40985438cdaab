  "description": "**A unique NFT collectible collection based on the forthcoming graphic novel created by #1 DJ Dimitri Vegas, with the originator and executive producer of the BATMAN Movie Universe, Michael Uslan and his son David**\r\n\r\n_Millions of years ago, Dinosaurs went extinct forever and mammals took over the planet. At least, thatâ€™s as far as we knowâ€¦_\r\n\r\n_After being frozen underground for thousands of years, a group of dinosaurs from another universe must master martial arts â€“ and how to be modern-day teenagers â€“ in order to defend the place they now call home, earth._\r\n\r\nThe book is written by Dimitri Vegas himself, in collaboration with Erik Burnham (Ghostbusters, Back To The Future, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). Together with a formidable team artists and Hollywood creatives, ASDW aims to grow into a potential multi-medium crossover brand and claim it's place in pop culture history.\r\n\r\nWelcome to the #DinoVerse ðŸ¦–"
