  "description": "It all started with a broken ice cream machine. An unsatisfied customer, unable to contain his rage, cast a curse on the Fast Food Frens.\n\nSince that dark day, the Frens began reporting visions, hauntings, and sightings of spooky spirits. Luckily, a brilliant fren trained in the healing arts discovered how to exorcise the Spooky spirits out of the Frens!\n\nFrom the 5,555 Fast Food Frens, 3,013 Spooky Frens were successfully exorcised. If you find an extra fry in the bag, it was most likely the work of a Spooky Fren!\n\nJoin our discord for exclusive giveaways, community-events, and an overall good-time: https://discord.gg/fastfoodfrens\n\nCheck out the original Fast Food Frens collection here: https://opensea.io/collection/fastfoodfrenscollection\n"
