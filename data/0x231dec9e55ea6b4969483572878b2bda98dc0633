  "description": "The Tiger & the Fish is an exploration of the impact of multiverses on perception. One illustration is rendered into 24 various styles, techniques and approaches, always keeping the same composition. 3 puzzle patterns allow the algorithm to rearrange the illustration in various original versions that will look like they are stuck between universes, creating a very large number of possible combinations."
