  "description": "GenomesDAO is a biotech DAO focused on the safe, private, and auditable monetization of genomic data. We’re merging the bleeding edge of encryption technology (AMD-SEV Vaults) with the blockchain to create the world’s first decentralized data brokering platform where users have full-custody and control of their genomic information.\n\nEach Geneticat NFT includes a whole-genome sequencing kit and a genome mining vault (powered by AMD). Once we’ve sequenced and vaulted your genome — you receive a 1:1 generative NFT based on a set of queries from your genome."
