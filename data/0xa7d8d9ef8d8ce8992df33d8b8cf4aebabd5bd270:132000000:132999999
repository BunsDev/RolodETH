  "description": "What would a transaction hash look like in space? This project explores the spatial properties of 32-byte hashes by intertwining bezier curves based on them. Floating on deformed blobs, both the curves and their companions are constructed by mapping parts of the hash to the screen. Forever yours to untie, slowly drifting in aether space - the metaverse is surely tangled. ——— Best enjoyed in live view - touch/click anywhere to stop the animation, press ’s’ to save an image."
