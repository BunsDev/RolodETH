  "description": "The ‘Sailor Dude’ or SD for short is the embodiment of TRP613, but also everyone! SD has collaborated with artists all over the world and transformed into so many different forms. This series focuses on the different ways SD is represented. The inspiration comes from pop art, 90’s sub culture, past artists and post modern weirdness. Bright colours and bold lines really bring the Sailor Dude to life. 100% hand-drawn 1:1.\n Do you even “Sailor Dude”?"
