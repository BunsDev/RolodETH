  "description": "Mint Your TOYS 👉 https://raregotchi.com/mint\n\nOfficial Links 👉 https://linktr.ee/Raregotchi\n\nRaregotchi is an NFT project inspired by the classic 90s virtual pets. It features Digi-physical TOYS, breedable PETS, and a whole ecosystem of Play-4-Fun games!\n\nThe Rareverse begins with a collection of 3000 Founder TOYS. There are three types, only 1000 units of each: \n\n🧢 School Kid\n\n🍧 Snow Cone\n\n👽 Alien Baby\n\nMinting is entirely random. You can't choose what TOY you get!\n\nRaregotchi TOYS come sealed in a digital package. As a TOY owner, you can choose to open the package and reveal the PETS inside the TOY, or you can leave it sealed forever in its pristine container.\n\nBut, be warned! Opening a sealed TOY package is an irreversible action. It cannot be undone! So, choose wisely which collector's path you want to take 🔮\n\nOwning a TOY unlocks many benefits in the Rareverse.
