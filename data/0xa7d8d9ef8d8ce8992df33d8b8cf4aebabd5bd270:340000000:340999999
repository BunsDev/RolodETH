  "description": "***Vahria*** is an inquiry into the breaking points between two and three dimensions. Using spheres I attempt to create a tension between flatness and depth. Regular bodies become distorted blobs and circles. Occasionally, triangles are revealed, which are fundamental units in computer graphics.\n\nThe project is also a playful comment on constructivism and its dominance as a visual style in current generative art NFTs. In Vahria, I take the deconstructivist approach, favouring fragmented volumes, asymmetries and skewness, over linear forms, straight lines and right angles.\n\nBy altering and distorting geometries on different levels, I intend to subvert the harmony and form sought-after with the constructivist approach, in favour of something uncontrolled, chaotic, and expressive.\n\nIt is strongly encouraged to see the pieces on **full screen**. Otherwise, details of the renders are missed. You can export high-resolution images of the mints to disk by clicking on the artwork and pressing one of the following keys:\n\n[1] : Full HD resolution (1440x1920)\n[2]: 4K resolution (2880x3840)\n[3]: 6k Resolution (4320x5760)"
