  "description": "Forever Apes blends what we love about NFTs - art, provenance, rarities - to luxury physicals. Itâ€™s a collection of 5000 Rise NFTs and 150 Genesis NFTs - both of which unlock your access to the Forever Apes community and allow you to claim physicals. The first physical is the Forever Apes coffee table book, which details the rise of BAYC and the NFT ecosystem in 2021. The book is a luxury piece designed to sit on your coffee table, with a high-quality finish inside and out. Inside, the pages contain the stories and art of the BAYC community. Your NFT gets you access to future physical claims. Visit [Forever Apes](https://www.foreverapes.io) for more details."
