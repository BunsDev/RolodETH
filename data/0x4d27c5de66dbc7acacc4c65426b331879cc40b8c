His work is often a trippy mixture of anarchic, cyberdelic, nonsensical and humorously subversive art. He is perhaps best known for his Twitter banners art and his classical paintings profanations. His work can be found on many of the major crypto art platforms out there today and he is also a renowned architect and designer within the Metaverse."
