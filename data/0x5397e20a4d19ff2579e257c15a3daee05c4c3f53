  "description": "Superchief Gallery is the world's 1st physical dedicated NFT gallery space.   Since we opened our first digital art gallery in Soho back in 2016, Superchief has held the belief that digital-native artwork was an essential art form to include as part of the larger art movement of our era. We have had been running our version of a traditional art gallery space since 2012 and by 2016 we knew well that there wasn't a clear way to monetize digital artwork. But we felt strongly that just because we couldn't sell it at the present time, didnâ€™t mean it should be kept apart from the art community at large. These are artists we feel are brilliant and exciting, and should be part of the cultural exchange."
