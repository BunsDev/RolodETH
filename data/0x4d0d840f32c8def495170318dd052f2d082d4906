  "description": "Virtue and Vice are at a constant battle for dominance of the human condition. The war has raged since the dawn of man, and will continue to rage on for years to come. Each soul has the opportunity to live a just and righteous life, upholding good, and bettering the human race. But just as easily as it is for one to ascend, one can fall from grace in the pursuit of self-satisfaction and, you know, just enjoying the shit out of life.\nThe kingdoms of Virtue and Vice grow stronger every day, which side of the trinity will you fall on?\nCollect your seraphs and be a shining example of virtue and all thatâ€™s right in the world. Faith in humanity restored! OR\nGive into your baser instincts and seek all the indulgences life has to offer. Some men just want to watch the world burn!\n"
