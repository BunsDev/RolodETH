  "description": "Pirates of the Arrland is the first collection of 10,000 Pirate characters created for the upcoming 3D high quality game with the Play to Earn concept. Having more than one Pirate means that you can seek for the most rare & unique traits, as they will have a real impact on the game. Pirates will have the ability to generate a utility $RUM token that later on will be used for breeding young Pirates, crafting items, levelling up abilities and more."
