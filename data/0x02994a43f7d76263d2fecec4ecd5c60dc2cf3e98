  "description": "A series of digital artworks paired with physical art pieces ðŸ’œ\n\nâ€‹\nThe project came from a desire to bring physical items into my NFT artistic journey. The challenge was to create a product that captures the essence of the artwork and displays its motion without the need for a digital screen.\n\n\nâ€‹Everything is on the website ðŸ”¥\n\nâ€‹"
