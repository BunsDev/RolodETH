  "description": "CK mfers is a 1,500 unit collection on the Ethereum blockchain. All CK mfers consist of a combination of unique traits with various rarities, giving each Kong a distinct reason to stay winning.\n\nCK mfers will be donating 15% of sales to the mfers treasury, tx will be posted at the end of each month from our Twitter @CKmfers.\n\nBy combining the characteristically distinguished look and feel of mfers with the beloved Kongz, the outcome was truly spectacular.   Uniquely generated, no two CK mfers are exactly alike, and their rarity scales from normal to extremely rare to legendary.\nThis is a CC0 Project. No roadmap , Do as you please & Always much respect to @sartoshi\nhttps://discord.gg/p3RCmXdkFH"
