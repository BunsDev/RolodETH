  "description": "Hillbilly Holler is a collection of 3,500 NFTs (1,526 Genesis and 1,974 [Gen2](https://opensea.io/collection/hillbillyhollergen2)) that are as unique as the personalities they are based on. The only difference is these folks live on the blockchain and love workin’ and searchin’ for Hollers which can be used by the community to access Hillbilly benefits."
