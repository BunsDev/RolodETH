  "description": "When you shoot on the streets, you flow with dynamism and diversity. There is so much happening around you and you do not have control over. In time, you adopt to the dynamism and start to see things differently. You develop an eye, like a 6th sense of what's going to happen or what can happen around you.\n\nThis is a collection presenting some of my photography on streets where \"that moment\" is very very hard to come by again."
