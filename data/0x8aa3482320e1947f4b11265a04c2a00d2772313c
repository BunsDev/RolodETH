  "description": "BAZ TOUR is a 7,200 generative NFT project that features the artwork of @kyokill_ and is focused on putting art at the intersection of web3 and golf. This NFT project is intended to allow people both an identity and utility on the course. Joining the BAZ TOUR allows each member to have a front row seat and see the opportunity that web3 has for IRL on-course use-cases. Use-cases range from a community involved golf brand as well as opportunity to generate utility that can eventually be used on-course. Tee off with the BAZ TOUR and learn more about the community that powers the Front 9."
