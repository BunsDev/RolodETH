  "description": "The MISFITS are wild in the streets gang! Roaming the back alleys looking for trouble is how these crazy mixed up Cats spend their days - dont look emâ€™ directly in the eyes gang - the MISFITS are unpredictable feline freaks!\n\nJust like all 0xGCGang NFTs, the MISFITS can be customized using one or more of our ADD-ON MODS! Check out our [Psycho Restraints](https://opensea.io/collection/0xgcgang-restraints) and [Loadout](https://opensea.io/collection/0xgcgang-loadout) collections to see just how wild you can make your Cats!\n\nThe 0xGCGang MISFITS is a collection of 500 unique NFTs that are part of the 0xGCGang universe. If you notice, most of the NFTs in the Misfits collection have double layers or one trait/layer over the other in the wrong place, that is because they're the Misfits!!! The 0xGCGang Misfits is a support collection to the [0xGutterCatGang](https://opensea.io/collection/0xgcgang)"
