  "description": "Spiromorphs are procedural roulette figures that investigate aesthetic relationships between form, symmetry and rotary motion. Variations are plotted using chained circles that overlay periodic continuous curves on an empty universe. The dynamic engine generates emergent morphologies of different colors and types while producing irregular yet harmonic forms. Charity: 5% of sales will be donated to National Alzheimerâ€™s Foundation, a nonprofit organization helping families who suffer from neurological diseases."
