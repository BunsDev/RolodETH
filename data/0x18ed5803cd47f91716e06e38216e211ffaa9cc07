  "description": "A limited series of 1,111 unique Sergs launched in March 2021. Each CryptoSerg is algorithmically generated to feature a special combination of 80 potential variables across 8 categories. This collection includes all the OG Sergs that have been migrated to our new smart contract and have claimed their matching 3D Serg. Sergs are chillin' hard in Sergograd all day, every day.\r\n\r\n[Click here](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptosergs-archive) to see the unmigrated CryptoSergs that are still on the old OpenSea contract\r\n\r\n[Click here](https://opensea.io/collection/sergs-gang) to see the new 3D Sergs collection."
