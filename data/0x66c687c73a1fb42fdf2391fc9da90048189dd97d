  "description": "The GOD Panels project is the first collaborative NFT project within the “Kamp Kilmer” ecosystem. The project utilizes a first-of-its-kind art engine; cutting-edge blockchain technology that enables the creation of collections of collaborative, dynamic, and continuously evolving, digital art pieces.\n\nParsing the name GOD out in multiples, invites the viewer to abstract and examine the word, and one’s own relationship with the word itself. The repetition and reproduction is me, trying to “get it right” to keep deeply contemplating the subject, constantly revisiting and revising it” Val Kilmer."
