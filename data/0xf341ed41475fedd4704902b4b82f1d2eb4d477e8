  "description": "3,333 Chads had grown increasingly greedy in their collective pursuit of tendies. Betting on the volatilities of the stock market just wasn't enough to satisfy their hunger.\n\nTo take charge of their destiny and bask in eternal riches, they left their moms' basements to forge a corporation.\n\nNot just any corporation.\n\nA corporation that'd put the likes of Walmart, Bayer and Unilever to shame:\n\nWall Street Chads Corp."
