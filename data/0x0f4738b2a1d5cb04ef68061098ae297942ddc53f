  "description": "Hypercastle Explorers is a community project building on top of Terraforms by Mathcastles. The collection consists of 1024 pieces of art representing a software SDK for Terraforms on a variety of (imaginary) storage formats. The software SDK is a free, open source project which will allow the underlying data for Terraforms to be viewed in the Unity game engine. This is a community led project and is not officially connected with the Mathcastles studio."
