  "description": "The Superballs are unique NFT doodles based on the original 264 Floating Heads. Some are more rare than others. Each [Super Nfty Floating Head](https://opensea.io/collection/super-nfty-floating-heads) was able to mint 10 Superballs for free. Each Superball was a whitelist spot for the Imps.\n\nCheck out the [IMPS](https://opensea.io/collection/imps-by-supernfty), the [Spirits](https://opensea.io/collection/spirits-by-supernfty), the [Floating Heads](https://opensea.io/collection/super-nfty-floating-heads), the [Rarity page](https://rarity.tools/superballsnft) and read more about SuperNfty on [Supernfty.com](https://www.supernfty.com/).
