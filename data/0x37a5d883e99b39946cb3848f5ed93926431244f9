  "description": "OurPath (ÈÅì) is a generative art collection. In the context of East Asian philosophy, Path is the intuitive knowing of \"life\" through having actually lived it. \n\nOurPath allows the owners to input a phrase - up to 50 characters long - to define its final form. In other words, OurPath is the brainchild of co-creation between owner and creator. \n\nMinting is now closed.\n\nOurPath is the genesis community badge in PathDAO. PathDAO is a community-first, decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) that creates value for investors and players in the growing blockchain metaverse (game + social + NFTs)."
