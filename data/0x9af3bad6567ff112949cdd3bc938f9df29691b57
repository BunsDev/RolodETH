  "description": "Creating art always helped me get through the hardest times in my life. I will convert fire inside into art for not to burn till dust...I will express all my feelings about the Russian invasion of my homeland in this collection.\n\nThis is my new reality... this is our new reality - UKRAINE.2022.\n\nEvery artwork has true stories behind it. It's not just art, it's a historical moment that I try to capture while I can... It will be an endless reminder of this war for freedom in Ukraine."
