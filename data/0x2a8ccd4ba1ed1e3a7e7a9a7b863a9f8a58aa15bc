  "description": "\"Genesis\" is a collection by Hollow.\n\nGenesis accumulates hand-painted original works and digital manipulations, creating several unique variations with glitchy and distorted effects, sometimes making the original unrecognizable. \n\nIt focuses on exploring the most recondite corners of the human mind, usually populated by depictions and transfigurations of the human being. \n\nWatercolour, pen, and acrylics are often the main mediums of his original pieces."
