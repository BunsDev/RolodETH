  "description": "MetaDrag Alpha Class is a collection of unique racers. Ownership grants you access to MetaDrag Racing: the online real-time competitive racing game. Initially, your NFT acts as your avatar, which can also modify the aesthetic of your car. \n\nWe're building a cross-community utility for other NFT projects. In our testing build, it's possible to stream eligible NFTs to customize your car, racer, and even parts of the race course in game, such as billboards, flags, etc. The game has been in development for 8 months, and though that may seem like a long time, it can take years to complete a game fully. That's why we're launching the game in phases: Alpha, Beta, and full release, so you can participate in the testing and creation of it all.\n\nWe're looking forward to partnering with communities, developers, gamers, artists, and degens to hear their input on what MetaDrag should be. \n\nSee you at the finish line, slowpokes."
