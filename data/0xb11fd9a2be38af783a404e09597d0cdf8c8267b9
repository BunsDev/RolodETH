  "description": "OWN .WEB3\nENJOY WEB3 LIFE\n\nAllow global users, no matter where they come from, to get a lifelong sdid for free, as their future digital identity, which can be freely circulated. Everyone should have a low-cost digital identity in the Web3 world. Bottom threshold and publicity are the proper paradigm of Web3.\n\nSDID, the digital identity on the chain, once owned, will be owned for life. It should not be artificially chained to the old shackles of annual payment. Let's break it.\n\nUsing. Web3 as the unified identity of projects or users' social accounts on the web, with the widespread adoption of SDID standards, individuals will not be locked in a single ecosystem or isolated data containers."
