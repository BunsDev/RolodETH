  "description": "- May 28th, 2017 - July 18th, 2018\r\n\r\n- For “Twin Flames” I photographed 100 sets of twins in honor of my fraternal twin, aiming to create body of work focused on the existence of multiple births and the phenomena of twindom through an immersive portrait survey. Twins and multiple siblings provide a lens on the magic and causality of biology. In our everyday society, twins, triplets et al. have an assigned position within all current and historical cultures—a shared tulpa of genetics, fate and timing. Twindom has a deep root in shared storytelling, its visuals conjure metatextual manifestations across the astrological, the mythological, the academic and the popular, stringing together tangents of the everyday and simultaneously karmic. By using three formats of film Polaroid, 120mm, and 4x5 by focusing on the simple idea of seeking an “intentional phenomenology” by direct image making, I can facilitate a broad and reflexive photographic engagement that is about these unique individuals."
