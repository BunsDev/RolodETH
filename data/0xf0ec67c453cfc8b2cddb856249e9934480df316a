  "description": "Created for the NFT community in p5.js by Oslo based artist Torgeir Lien. The particles/lines of Flow Fields follow along the gradient of fully generated images - it's basically gen art inside of gen art! So each piece is created, or 'inspired' by another secret piece of art, or the pieces 'source', giving our collection a unique feature and potential future utility when we reveal the piece sources to our holders via unlockable content!"
