  "description": "Infinites AI is a collection of 512 unique artworks generated at the time of the minting process. Each infinite was created utilizing the intersection of two generative processes: A StyleGAN trained with a curation of artworks from the Great Masters, and an on-chain generative process that augmented a selection of the generated pieces from the first process.\r\nA set of images previously generated by the StyleGAN are used by a customized software to create an on-chain augmentation. The custom software is written in three.js and generates unique artifacts based on Ethereum transactions.\r\n\r\nCheck also [Infinites IRL](https://opensea.io/collection/infinites-irl)\r\n\r\n\r\nOr other projects by [far](https://twitter.com/0xfar):\r\n\r\n[mSeascape(s)](https://opensea.io/collection/mseascapes)\r\n\r\n[processes](https://opensea.io/collection/farprocesses)\r\n\r\n[Fragments](https://opensea.io/collection/fragments-far)"
