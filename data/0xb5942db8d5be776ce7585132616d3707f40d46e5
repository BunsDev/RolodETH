  "description": "Noun Cats are two 5,000 piece collections: The Invisibles and The Cats. Each Cat has an identical Invisible, missing the body, and it's your job to either acquire the other piece or work with the other owner to interact with an additional smart contract to mint a new type of creature in the Noun Cats universe. Find your Nounterpart."
