  "description": "Spherical Harmonics Genesis is a NFT collection of 1770 procedurally generated to guarantee 100% unique results. All equally rare, beautiful and special in its own particular way. This collection was created by PAGESVFX a veteran of the visual effects industry with film credits such as Avatar, Gravity, Harry Potter 5 and many more.  \n\nThe procedural system takes into consideration hundreds of thousands of shape variations, color ranges and noise patterns, as well as 87 different lighting and reflection scenarios to produce millions of unique possibilities. We believe the NFT space deserves a collection that focuses on beauty with guaranteed uniqueness.\n\nWe hope you enjoy my collection."
