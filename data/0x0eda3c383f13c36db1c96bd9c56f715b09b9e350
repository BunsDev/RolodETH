  "description": "We are 10,000 souls wandering the Ethereum Plane, seeking a new home.\n\nAvius Animae is an NFT collection that launched with the aim of doing good with crypto. We donated half of our mint to LGBTQIA+ supporting charities and have since raised over $200,000 for the same causes. This September, we are launching an elixir to continue the storytelling of the Avius Animae with their nemeses, the Avius Obscuris. Visit our Discord or our Twitter for more information. \n\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/swFtXur3db\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/aviusanimaenft\nWebsite: https://www.aviusanimae.xyz/"
