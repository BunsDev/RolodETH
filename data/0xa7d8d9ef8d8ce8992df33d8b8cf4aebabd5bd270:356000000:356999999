  "description": "*The purpose of life is to live.*\n\n**Essenza** is a labor of love. The essence of Art in my eyes.\nAnd Art, sometimes, can haunt you. Can consume you.\n\nWhen you pour yourself into something, it's hard to let it go.\n\nBorn from a sketch made more than 3 years ago, this was intended to be my genesis on Art Blocks.\nIt took me another year and a half, countless refinements, Rinascita, more refinements, and a rewrite from scratch to finally be ready to share this with the rest of the world.\n\nIt's personal, and it's intense. A fragment of my story.\nThe end of an era, and hopefully, the beginning of a new one.\n\nNo matter how hard it can be. If you truly love something, you need to learn how to set it free."
