  "description": "The RPD Metaverse is full of treasures, and the Cyberwarriors are always ready to hunt these treasures, as they draw energy from the five-elements between the heaven and the earth to refine their cultivated souls.\nThe RPD has fused the mysterious oriental context of the zodiac, the five elements and the culture of cultivation, to produce illustration-grade hand-painted NFTs of zodiac-based battle mechs, which are designed as digital identities for guild members to share in the future benefits of the RPD.\nThe NFTs will be issued in 12 rounds irregularly, within the first round recently, there will be 888 Tiger Warriors NFT launched recently.\n"
