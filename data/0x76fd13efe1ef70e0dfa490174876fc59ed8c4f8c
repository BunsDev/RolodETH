  "description": "Shrouded in secrecy and emanating exclusivity, the Skull Society is a group of 1,777 Skulls with uniquely hand drawn traits by renowned Neo-Pop Artist Theodoru Badiu. \r\n\r\nThis collection pays homage to “Gavroche”. Quite clever and imbued with street smarts, this lovable character reflects a piece of us all: a complex amalgamation of emotions on a trip through the human experience.\r\n\r\nThese aren’t your average skulls. Each art piece is a reflection of Theodoru's belief that we all can be pillars of hope regardless of the gruesomeness of reality."
