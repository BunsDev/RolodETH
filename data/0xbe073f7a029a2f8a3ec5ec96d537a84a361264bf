  "description": "The first NFT Collection by Regina Silveira (b. 1939), “WALLS Series”, 2022, is entangled with “15 laberintos”, a serigraphy series created in 1971. In her own digital interpretation, Regina adds new dimensions to the work: volume, time, and action, making them more perceivable and real, even though delivered only through pixels."
