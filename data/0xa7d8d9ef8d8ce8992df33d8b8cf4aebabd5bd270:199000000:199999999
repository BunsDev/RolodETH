  "description": "Prismatic explores color, refraction, and interaction. Every invocation is presented as a still image, but responds to keystrokes with transformations. Start with the arrow keys. Please note: This project is not presented with any features or traits. While features were used in the algorithm in order to introduce variation, each invocation of Prismatic is intended to be experienced as a piece of a whole. The project itself is the prism, each mint is a moment captured as we pass through it."
