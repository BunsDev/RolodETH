  "description": "Crazy Tigers live on Planet Panthera, it is under the threat of alien invasion. The Aliens abduct tigers putting them to work on their giant space stations. Tigers live their lives as normal most of the time, working, having fun and making cubs ;). Sometimes they are recruited to go into space to fight off alien attacks. Their currency is $meat coin that they work to buy food - meat."
