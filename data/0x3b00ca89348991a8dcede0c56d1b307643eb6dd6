Well lucky you!\nPump it is a brutally honest project where we hold everyhing to zero and vibe.\n\n\nAbsolutely nothing will happen when minting this.\nAbsolutely nothing will happen if you sell.\nAbsolutely nothing will happen if you hold.\nJust have fun.\n\nIf you sell you are a bigot. If you hold, you are a bigot. If you put in hidden, you are a bigot.\nWe are all making stupid degen plays, so why not have fun while doing it."
