  "description": "Predating the launch of Ethereum by five months, in February 2015 conceptual artist Sarah Meyohas released the first tokenization of art on the blockchain: Bitchcoin.\n\nSix years later, the artist migrated Bitchcoin from its native chain to Ethereum, releasing reserved Bitchcoins backed by art from her seminal Cloud of Petals exhibition at Red Bull Arts New York. For this release, the artist chose to back each Bitchcoin with a unique pressed rose petal. The total supply of this release is 3291.\n\n480 tokens were auctioned in a dedicated sale with Phillips, and featured in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nwww.sarahmeyohas.com for more information on Cloud of Petals and Bitchcoin.
