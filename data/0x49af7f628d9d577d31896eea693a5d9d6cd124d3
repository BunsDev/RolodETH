  "description": "The Toy Stash drop is live! https://www.toyboogers.io/mint\n\nToy Stash is a Hand-Generated collection of 11,111 NFTs. Each Toy Stash was curated and built by Doug using a generator one NFT at a time! This way each and every single Toy Stash NFT has his personal touch and vibes!\n\nAs many people suspected, Stash is the one who stuck the booger on the teleportation machineâ€™s focusing crystal in the original Toy Boogers backstory! This is what caused the wild transformations to occur to the characters, just as Stash had devised. \n\nThis time he rigged his hamster wheel onto the metaverse teleportation machine and activated it while running as fast as he could on the hamster wheel. This let him go through the teleportation vortex thousands of times and new versions of himself were created and teleported into the metaverse to live forever as NFTs!"
