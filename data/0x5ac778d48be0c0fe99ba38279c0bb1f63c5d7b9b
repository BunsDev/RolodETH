  "description": "For Centuries, Blossoms have been fighting against The Vines in order to protect the people of Purgatory. From past experiences we know that The Vines are not friends of Purgatory, and they want to take over our land and our people. We know that we can't reply on the Gods to help us, so we have to take care of ourselves. we have to be strong and protect our land. We know that we can do this and we will never give up our fight. if we lose, then who knows what'll happen to us!"
