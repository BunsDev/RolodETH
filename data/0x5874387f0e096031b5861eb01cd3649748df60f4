  "description": "i am a traveling salesman for my family business. located in the northeast of north america. i constantly find myself in awe of the beauty around me while i'm on the road but with no time to stop. a big part of my life is inspired from behind the dashboard. so i began to create while traveling from the drivers seat || this is a growing collection over the course of a full year & 4 seasons (winter spring summer fall). unique properties can be found to continue creating a truly unique image! each dashboard has been paired with a song to further that function of the mood and depict my personal emotion. all will be minted on my own smart contract! after purchase you will receive 1. a link to the song paired to the image. 2. digital download of the image. 3. my gratitude from me and my family. welcome to the road trip!"
