  "description": "A game where every aspect of the universe changes, according to community actions. Anyone that holds one of the 3000 NFTs will be able to choose what will happen next. Everything between story, comics, economy, and much more will be dynamically affected by those decisions. It's a game that we, as a community, will decide how and if we're gonna survive.\n\nNot alone."
