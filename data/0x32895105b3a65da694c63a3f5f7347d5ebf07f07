  "description": "[furbrawls.io](https://www.furbrawls.io/)\n\n[Super Tigers](https://opensea.io/collection/super-tigers)\n\nSuper Bunnies are rare generative hand-drawn superheroes sworn to protect our universe. \nDark Super Bunnies are opposed by their hero counterparts the Light Super Bunnies. The perfect balance for the universe. Yin Yang and the never ending battle between good and evil.\n\nA community-driven project, each bunny is your membership card and gives you a vote in our collective future: the first being how to forge our immersive ecosystem, where a slick multiplayer FPS game is already being explored â€“ one that allows people to fight as their bunny avatars and earn NFTs and tokens as they subdue humanity.\n\nStarting from a limited edition of 5K on the Ethereum chain, their origin story includes a deflationary breeding mechanism (burning Bunnies for even rarer creatures). Every bunny is uniquely made from over 150 different features - no unpopular attributes! 'GOD MODE' anyone?"
