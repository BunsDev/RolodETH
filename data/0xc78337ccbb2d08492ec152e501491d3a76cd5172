  "description": "FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE GROTTO...\n\nJ48BAFORMS (pronounced Jabbaforms) is a multifaceted artistic experiment on the Ethereum blockchain. The series contains 4,848 works of art that were minted at random.\n\nThe project began with 1,000 hand drawn \"LEGACYFORMS\" produced by the artist, which serves as the foundation for the series. After digitizing each LEGACYFORM, the dataset was processed through our GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). Over the course of two weeks, the neural network learned and interpreted the original drawings, thereby producing machine-generated variants that feel like an organic extension of the artistâ€™s work. J48BAFORMS offer an exciting array of rarities and styles, ranging from original hand drawn pieces to animated works with accompanying musical scores."
