  "description": "In 2021, tired of seeing the stupidity of apes who greedily monopolize the ethereum blockchain…\nA pack of 3,333 unique wolves started to revolt and rise to take over the metaverse from them.\nLed by a rich market wolf, they’re starting a big war and plan to eat up the apes and all other animals that stand before them.\nSo, with the support from several crypto whales, they are determined to win and make a massive fortune!\nAnd strangely, nobody knows what their final goal in the crypto world is…\nBut one thing’s for sure, when the market wolf shows himself…\nThe world will tremble!"
