  "description": "*SOLD OUT*\n\nCrypto Calaveras is a generative art project featuring the works of 8 different Mexican artists: Crimson Rider, Thundersteel, Billie Alter, EMSAR, JAMEX, Stutter, Payos, and RΞY.\n\nThe main theme of this project is traditional ´Mexican Day of the Dead´ skulls. Each artist, however, reinterprets the theme through their own personal style and vision.  \n\nOur team sliced up each artist’s calaveras and generated 1,584 completely unique versions. This gives the skulls a mix of various styles and expressions, surprising the viewer with variety across a single piece.   \n\nA key component of the Calavera Crew is to bring awareness to the arts coming out of the Mexican region and shine a spotlight on the artists involved. It is also our goal to produce NFTs, artworks, and experiences that are created from the heart <3 !\n\nCrypto Cavalera Membership:\n\n[MEMBERSHIP](https://opensea.io/collection/cryptocalaveras/)"
