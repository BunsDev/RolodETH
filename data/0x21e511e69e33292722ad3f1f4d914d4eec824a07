  "description": "# What you see is not a render! \nParallel Polis has issued 12 unique physical tribute medals made of 250g silver - each medal is represented by an NFT. \n\nThe physical counterparts are claimable by the current owner of the particular NFT - once claimed, the NFT's status will be updated.\n\n[Parallel Polis](https://paralelnipolis.cz/en/) is a non-governmental non-profit organization that has been issuing commemorative silver coins covered by Bitcoin since 2017. The coins are published in a limited edition of 100 pieces and are dedicated to personalities who publicly opposed the state establishment and whose work significantly contributed to the freedom of the Internet - Ross Ulbricht, Julian Assange, Aaron Swartz and Edward Snowden.\n\n- More info about Paraleln√≠ Polis:\nhttps://www.paralelnipolis.cz/o-nas/en/ \n- More info about Silver Coins project:\nhttps://www.paralelnipolis.cz/coins/ \n- More info about Silver Medals project:\nhttps://www.paralelnipolis.cz/medals\n"
