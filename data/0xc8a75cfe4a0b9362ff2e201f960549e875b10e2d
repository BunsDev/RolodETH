  "description": "The Singularity Collection is the second release by AIIV, an AI art collaboration by Ravi Vora and Phil Bosua.\r\n\r\n1000 AI generated unique artworks exploring the AI singularity through art.\r\n\r\nWhen we all inevitably experience singularity, what will it feel like? Could we all be constructing a subjective perspective of our current reality that constrains the true vision of the future?\r\n\r\nThe thin veil between reality and our imagination disappears, and our experience of this world transforms from what it is - into what we want it to be. We free ourselves from the constraints of a world that is less than we hoped and step into a world that can be more than we imagine.\r\n\r\nVisions that feel familiar but also not of this world. Maybe the AI is telling us it is already here - if we only decide to see it.\r\n\r\nAIIV is part of the AIM Collective"
