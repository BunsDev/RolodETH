  "description": "Gramatik, real name Denis Jašarević, has released thirteen albums, four EPs, numerous original scores, singles, and remixes all for free. In 2013, he established his own record label, Lowtemp, allowing him to further realize his idea of music being a free medium. Following a long history of file sharing with his music, Gramatik released his entire discography in partnership with BitTorrent. Gramatik has been a long-time supporter of blockchain technology, participating in a multitude of crypto projects over the last decade and establishing himself as a leading advocate for blockchain's potential to revolutionize the music industry and the artist-fan relationship."
