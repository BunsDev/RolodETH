  "description": "They don't know what year it is. The first thing they can remember is falling down onto a planet full of strange creatures who can't seem to shut up about NFTs. How did Bizarros get here? Who or what is behind this? And who are all these other characters? Cats, monkeys, dogs... \n\nPlay the upcoming game to explore parody versions of NFT communities, meet famous NFT personalities, and, as a Bizarro, figure out who you are and why you're there. Complete quests, battle enemies, compete in mini-games (high scores record on chain), and explore.\n\nBizarros are a collection of 10,000 unique 3D Bizarro NFTsâ€” unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bizarro doubles as a ticket to Bizarro World RPG and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which will be access to The Tavern, a hangout place where you can meet and chat with fellow Bizarros, and help shape the storyline and features of Bizarro World the game. Visit https://www.bizarro.club for full roadmap."
