  "description": "it is a fact that you cannot leave Africa. It is always with you, theyâ€™re inside your head. Our rivers run in currents in the swirl of your thumbprints; our drumbeats counting out your pulse; our coastline the silhouette of your soul. \nOur legends have graced the stair unimaginable with their fearlessness, dignity, and respect, have broken uncharted lanes and their memories live with us forever so their footprints will be left on the digital marble forever as a tribute to all the legends of Africa and Africanism.  Since we are committed to ensuring grassroots development 30% of the sales will be used to provide education for art students and 20% donate to sustainable development in the planting of trees in various communities. Wakanda for life."
