  "description": "Impermanence is the nature of our world. While all of existence is in perpetual flux, the only constant is this moment. We wake each day to a breathing, living reality. This is why I focus on living in the present. There is nothing more precious than now. The one immutable quality of existence is perpetual change. Be with it always.\n\nThis piece is a real time geo-location specific NFT, the first of its kind to display your personalized local weather conditions. Watch each day as conditions change from cold to warm, night to day, snow storm, rain clouds, fog banks and many others. There are even secret hidden conditions that only the most patient observers will be able to spot when conditions are just right. In partnership with Transient Labs, we hope you enjoy the magic of Impermanence. \n"
