  "description": "Andradite comes from the transposition of my Modo7 protocol into sculptures. Heavy brutalist shapes that come together to create dark monolithic structures half way between sculpted objects and troglodytic architecture. The name of the script comes from the andradite, a stone which crystallizes following cubic patterns and can be found in deep dark color. The gradient backgrounds create depth and mood and recall the way they showcase the stones in professional mineral photographs."
