  "description": "As an agent of The Syndicate, not all things will come easy, but some things come too easy. Itâ€™s a life of paradox. Where information is currency and we share that wealth and guard it at the same time. We share our silent weapons of war amongst ourselves while keeping them hidden from the outside world. The Syndicate is everywhere, yet is never seen. When you meet a fellow agent you know that they know that you know. But nothing needs to be said. Our success is a thing of legend and rumor. Syndicate893 can only be understood from the inside.`\n\nWelcome to the Dynasty\n\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/syndicate893"
