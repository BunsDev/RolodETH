  "description": "A limited collection of on-chain haiku poems, written by IKANI and curated by the community.\n\nInspired by the Japanese haiku poetic form, AWAKENING records the instantaneous feelings that emerge in interactions with nature. Each of the unique poems in the series originated out of a generative process that can be traced to one of 22 genesis poems.\n\nOwning an IKANI: AWAKENING poem grants its holder the right to mint a free poem pass in every IKANI.AI banner NFT drop."
