  "description": "Let’s enjoy our sins, let’s dive in our lives for perfect sinners, but let’s seek forgiveness for our biggest trespass and let’s clean up the mess we have made.\nWe can accept our vices, bask in our mistakes, put a like on our faults, reset our conscience. As long as we open our eyes on what, now, is more important than anyone of us.\n\nThat’s how, with the series “LIKE A VIRGIN”, composed by 7 NFT 1/1, I want to bring back the attention on what is really important, in a new order of priorities."
