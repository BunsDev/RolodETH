  "description": "Spatial is the Metaverse for culture where artists and organizers are empowered to create the world they imagine. Virtual architects play an important role in shaping what’s possible. To make their work accessible for use, Spatial is collaborating with them to mint collectable editions. \r\n\r\nAn immersive experience platform since 2016, Spatial takes pride in providing collaborative community events in top tier designed environments. These mints are spaces created by our community for our community that can be taken to any world. Spatial believes in an open Metaverse — where assets and communities don’t exist in walled gardens and there is room for everyone to belong."
