  "description": "Deep Sea Jelly is a collective of 10,000 Jellyfish NFTâ€™s who have explored the unknown regions of the deep sea and have now found their way into the metaverse. \n\nThough these cute, bubbly, and endearing jellyfish may add some cuteness to your collection, every single jellyfish plays an existential role in putting a spotlight on the significance of a jellyfish and the health of our marine ecosystem."
