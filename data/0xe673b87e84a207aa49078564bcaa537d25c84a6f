  "description": "Paintglyphs are dynamic and upgradable art, inspired by the Autoglyphs. New symbols, sizing, and mechanics have been introduced, but the original plotting algorithm has been repurposed for Paintglyphs.\n\nWhile Cryptopunks have inspired a myriad of spin offs, Autoglyphs have largely remained alone, with the only significant exception being Colorglyphs. Paintglyphs offer a fresh take on Autoglyphs, while remaining in close proximity to the original's design."
